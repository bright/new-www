Then if our device is familiar with force touch we can easily register our <code>UIViewController</code> for force touch events. Take a look at this snippet:</p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/kamwysoc/a08f80ddcc3f064a881650cc2dafc1eb.js\"></script>\n<p>As you can see the above code uses the <code>traitCollection</code> property. It is available in every <code>UIViewController</code> and provides information about controller environment. In documentation we can read about it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A trait collection encapsulates the system traits of an interface's environment</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So when we access <code>traitCollection</code> and get information about <code>forceTouchCapability</code>. It will return one of these values:</p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/kamwysoc/6f1cc95592658e495ef6a39b5e6df153.js\"></script>\n<p>Another method that needs some attention is <code>registerForPreviewing</code>. It register <code>UIViewController</code> for force touch events. Documentation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Registers a view controller to participate with 3D Touch preview (peek) and commit (pop).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is also <code>unregisterForPreviewing(withContext previewing: UIViewControllerPreviewing)</code> function available. After unregistering, all features related to 3d Touch will be turned off for view controller that called <code>unregisterForPreviewing</code> method.</p>\n<h2>All registered, what's next?</h2>\n<p>We should take a look on <code>UIViewControllerPreviewingDelegate</code> - this delegate class is responsible for handling events from 3d Touch in view controller that implements methods of this delegate.</p>\n<p>There are two methods:</p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/kamwysoc/aff420c55492b809990e170dedddaade.js\"></script>\n<p>First method is responsible for catching force-touch events. For example if you firmly press some view in <code>UIViewController</code>, that conform to <code>UIViewControllerPreviewingDelegate</code>, the method will be called once until you release your finger or press more strongly the view. As you can see this method returns an optional <code>UIViewController?</code>. The controller returned from this function is used for action called Peek. There is also a second parameter named <code>location</code> it will give you an information about at what <code>CGPoint</code> in ViewController's view, the app received force touch. Here you can see what the Peak looks like:</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kamwysoc/kamwysoc.github.io/master/assets/posts/3dTouch/peak.gif\">\n</p>\n<p>Second method is responsible for an event called Pop. When the 3d touch mechanism detects that you strongly pressed the <code>ViewController</code> that was returned from <code>viewControllerForLocation</code> method, it will call and pass that <code>UIViewController</code> as <code>viewControllerToCommit</code> to second\n<code>previewingContext(_ previewingContext: UIViewControllerPreviewing, commit viewControllerToCommit: UIViewController)</code> function.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Important thing is that when the <code>viewControllerForLocation</code> returns <code>nil</code> the second function <code>viewControllerToCommit</code> will be not called.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In this method we can present <code>viewControllerToCommit</code> or do another actions e.g animate touched view.</p>\n<h2>Implementation</h2>\n<p>Let's imagine that you have <code>UIViewController</code> that contains two <code>UIImageViews</code> with beautiful apple images inside.\nFor this controller we want to implement 3d Touch Peak&#x26;Pop feature.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kamwysoc/kamwysoc.github.io/master/assets/posts/3dTouch/view_controller.png\">\n</p>\n<p>In <code>viewDidLoad()</code> function, register our controller for force touch events.</p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/kamwysoc/ab027712bcc2355293a589326d53dcbf.js\"></script>\n<p>Create and add the <code>UIImageViews</code> to the array named <code>forceTouchableViews</code>. In my implementation I created <code>AppleImageView</code> class that inherits from <code>UIImageView</code> and have a <code>appleDescription</code> property.</p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/kamwysoc/fee49ab346af7b034d944ee4a1185034.js\"></script>\n<p>You might be wondering why the <code>forceTouchableViews</code> is needed. But keep calm and continue reading, I will get back to it later :-).</p>\n<p>Now let's create an extension for our <code>UIViewController</code> that will conform to <code>UIViewControllerPreviewingDelegate</code></p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/kamwysoc/9d61c4893dad27b18276311ccb3b0cb1.js\"></script>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For my purposes I created an Apple model class that holds name and image property. Also I created AppleDescriptionViewController which will be responsible for representing the <code>viewControllerToCommit</code> parameter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>About the code</h2>\n<p>As you can see in <code>viewControllerForLocation</code> method, I iterate through my <code>forceTouchableViews</code> and check using <code>wasTouched(in: location)</code> function, if some of views was touched. If no view was touched the function will return nil.\nOk, but what that <code>wasTouched(in: location)</code> function does?</p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/kamwysoc/c63284cf2b098fd0906c24583a718040.js\"></script>\n<p>It converts input point to location in superview(if exist) and then checks if that location is inside UIView's bounds. If yes then it will return <code>true</code> and we can say that our view was touched.</p>\n<p>If I determine that some of my apple image views was touched, then I create a <code>AppleDescriptionViewController</code> and return it.</p>\n<p>The only thing just left is to press a little bit harder on our apple image view and we will get into last step. The body of that function is simple as follow:</p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/kamwysoc/765e20cc3d9734e2edab387ea7b5d1a9.js\"></script>\n<h2>Result</h2>\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kamwysoc/kamwysoc.github.io/master/assets/posts/3dTouch/result.gif\">\n</p>\n<p>pretty nice, huh?</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I don't like the way to determine what view user touched. Checking a point and calculating location for that is not really nice. Maybe another, better way to implementing 3d touch mechanism for views could be: extending a <code>UIView</code> class by some property like <code>3dTouchGestureRecognizerDelegate</code> then implementing some methods like in <code>UIViewControllerPreviewingDelegate</code>. Then we don't have to check whether view was touched, because on the delegate methods the touched view could be passed as method parameter. Something familiar to <code>gestureRecognizer</code>. Maybe in future iOS updates the API will be changed?\nTo sum up, <code>UIViewControllerPreviewing</code> allows us the create pretty nice features and I highly recommend to use that and make your application better!</p>\n<p>The whole implementation with example app you can find in my <a href=\"https://github.com/kamwysoc/3dTouchPeak-Pop\">GitHub repository</a> .</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading, and see you soon!</p>\n<p>*This blog is cross posted with my <a href=\"https://wysockikamil.com/3dtouch-peak-and-pop/\">personal blog</a> *</p>","excerpt":"In my previous post I wrote about adopting UIApplicationShortcutItems in your app. Now it's time to implement Peak&Pop - a feature provided…","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":"3D Touch - Peak&amp;Pop feature.","description":null,"author":"kwysocki","tags":["iOS","swift","3d touch"],"date":"2016-12-10T23:00:00.000Z","image":null},"timeToRead":4,"fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/new-www/new-www/src/mdData/blog/2016-12-11-3dtouch-peak-and-pop.md"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://brightinventions.pl"}}},"pageContext":{"fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/new-www/new-www/src/mdData/blog/2016-12-11-3dtouch-peak-and-pop.md"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2189233960","3181594896"]}
