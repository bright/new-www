## advantages of a custom food delivery integration

### adjustable solution for new and legacy POS

Smooth integration regardless of the size or age of your POS system.

### supporting old and new restaurant devices

Creating software supporting the restaurant's actual POS devices.

### standing out from the competition

A custom solution allows you to develop unique features that differentiate your service from competitors.

### no ongoing licensing fees

While the initial cost of custom development can be higher, you avoid ongoing licensing fees that are typical with third-party solutions, which can lead to cost savings over time.

### data-driven integration

Solution based on analytics insights about your users and their feedback rather than generic assumptions.

### adding non-standard features

Unlike generic solutions, a custom integration includes specific functionalities that are most relevant to your operations.

### building for growth

Design the system to scale with your business limiting upfront the limitations imposed by third-party software.

### ensuring compliance and security

A custom-built solution can be designed with your specific security needs in mind and fully compliant with local regulations and tax law.

### flexibility in maintenance

Control the schedule and scope of maintenance, updates, and upgrades, ensuring minimal disruption to your clients.
