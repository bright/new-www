Headquartered in the city of Gdańsk – a hub of innovation and technological expertise – our team has been at the forefront of [the dynamic Polish IT sector](/blog/five-things-you-should-know-about-working-with-Polish-developers/) for over 13 years.

Gdansk has proven itself as a magnet for global business giants, with industry leaders like Intel, Amazon, Nordea, and Lufthansa choosing to establish a presence here. From the convenience of Gdansk Airport, you can easily access over 20 countries with the majority of European destinations just a short flight away—many within a mere two hours.

If you are considering partnering with a company from Gdańsk, go deeper into [the advantages our city has to offer](https://brightinventions.pl/blog/hiring-software-development-agency-based-in-gdansk/). We can join forces and explore together the potential of Poland's tech scene.  

## our expertise

We offer custom software development for organizations of all shapes and sizes – from emerging startups, mid-sized companies, and consultancy agencies, to renowned NGOs and international organizations.

### [mobile development](/our-areas/mobile-app-development/)

We have built over 50 mobile applications for both iOS and Android systems for clients ranging from well-established companies to startup businesses, including [Just Eat Takeaway](/projects/system-for-restaurants/), [Relevo](/projects/eco-friendly-app/), [Heinrich Schmid](/projects/document-management-apps-construction/), and [Circles](/projects/online-group-support/).

### [IoT development](/our-areas/iot-development/)

We specialize in integrating smart bluetooth devices into sophisticated systems. We have cooperated with clients representing the industrial, healthcare, and [retail](/projects/system-for-restaurants/) sectors.

### [healthcare software development](/our-areas/healthcare-software-development/)

We assist our partners in developing products that have a meaningful impact on the lives of their end users. By building an [engagement app for chronically ill patients](/projects/solution-for-parkinsons-patients/), a [digital guide for future moms](/projects/pregnancy-app/), or an [online therapy platform](/projects/online-group-support/), we take part in the global digital healthcare movement.

### [MVP development](/our-areas/mvp-development/)

We craft MVPs to quickly validate ideas for the software solutions. We’ve built numerous MVPs including a [humanitarian aid solution which turned into a global product](/projects/card-tracking-system/).

### [cloud computing](/our-areas/cloud-services/)

As an official **AWS partner**, we help our partners scale their solutions reducing costs for infrastructure. We also offer full support during deployment and migration.
