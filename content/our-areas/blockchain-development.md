## what is blockchain and why you might need it?

Simply saying **blockchain is a chain of blocks connected thanks to cryptography**. Blockchain is decentralized. Therefore practically no one can take control of it. Although blockchain is mostly known as a technology behind cryptocurrency, it goes way beyond that. 

Blockchain could be **a perfect fit for startups and larger companies** building software products for the **fintech, healthcare, or banking industries**. If you plan or already are building products with a focus on **decentralization, transparency, and security**, you should base your web or mobile application on the blockchain.

## blockchain solutions that we have developed

We specialize in integrating web and mobile apps with blockchain solutions. For over 4 years we have been developing products using **Ethereum** technology. Apart from that we are **Substrate** enthusiasts. We have built **BrightTreasury** module application to **support the Polkadot community** built around the Substrate. We use and support the Substrate framework because we believe that it is the future of the internet. 

### BrightTreasury

**BrightTreasury is our original product supporting the blockchain community**. It is a standalone web application that allows performing basic actions on the Treasury and Bounties modules of Polkadot and Kusama Substrate networks. The app is **a part of the Web3 Foundation (W3F) grants program**. The goal of our product is to make blockchain accessible to more users. The app is still being developed by our team with **full support from Polkadot and Kusama**.
