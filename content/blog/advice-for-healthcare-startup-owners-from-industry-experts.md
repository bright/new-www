**In the complex area of health tech, understanding the market and navigating regulatory challenges are crucial. I had a chance to sit down with experienced startup owners and industry experts at the [HLTH Europe conference](https://europe.hlth.com/), which happened in June, 2024. They share their insights and experiences.**

## Understanding the Market



* “First, understand the market. It sounds simple, but the buyers can be confusing. For example, some companies want to work with a healthcare system but need to be selling to a payer. Or they aim to work with physicians, not recognizing that about 80% of physician groups are employed by hospital systems or payers. **Understanding the buyer and payer dynamics is crucial**. The regulatory space is another challenge. Having FDA approval is not enough—you also need CMS and Medicaid approval to pay for your product or device. Without this, your product or service won't be implemented or used in the US.” - **Dr. Adam Brown,** Founder @ ABIG HEALTH


* "The U.S. healthcare system's complexity is pivotal to understand, as **different states have different regulations and market dynamics.**" — **Aahuti Rai**, Strategic Advisor and Venture Partner @ Four Points Consulting


*  “The Spanish market is quite complicated. Everyone will ask you to start with a pilot study, which is important. My advice is to perform a paid pilot study, even if it's a small amount of money. This shows commitment and value. **Assess the results, demonstrate the technology's value, and then move to a contract**.” - **Silvia Raga,** CEO & Founder @ DyCare



## Navigating Regulatory Challenges

* "Familiarize yourself with FDA and CMS approvals to ensure your product can be implemented and reimbursed in the U.S. market." — **Dr. Adam Brown**


* "Be aware of regulatory differences across states and tailor your approach accordingly." — **Aahuti Rai**


*  "The main challenge is ensuring the clinical validation of our technology since it's a medical device. This is the real challenge of what we do." - **Silvia Raga**



Building Credibility and Trust

"Ensure medical credibility by involving practitioners and experts in your development process." — Dr. Claudia Pastides

"For digital health solutions, establish trust by ensuring data security and compliance with privacy regulations." — Dr. Claudia Pastides

4. Adapting to Cultural and Mindset Shift

"Be prepared to address cultural resistance within healthcare systems, which often lag behind technological advancements." — Aahuti Rai

"Engage stakeholders effectively to foster acceptance and buy-in for new technologies." — Aahuti Rai

5. Leveraging Interoperability

"Focus on creating solutions that enhance interoperability between different healthcare systems and EHRs." — Dr. Frank Hoffmann

"Highlight the benefits of your solution in reducing redundancies and improving patient care through seamless data sharing." — Dr. Frank Hoffmann

6. Strategic Adaptations and Mindsets for Success (?)

"Be prepared for slow decisions and price-sensitive public sectors. Investors may push for speed, but high quality at low costs is crucial." — Mohammad Al Ubaydli

"Move fast and focus on solving one problem at a time. If possible, sell your solution outside of medical device categorization to start generating revenue and gather real-world evidence quickly." — Michel Valstar

"Founding a company requires resilience, purpose, and willpower to persist through challenges. Embrace failure as a step towards success, solve problems rather than clinging to ideas, and build a strong team." — Fernando Campos
