**Are mHealth app users more likely to uninstall your app compared to others? How can you keep your users engaged and committed to your solution? Protect your healthcare app from the risks of user abandonment by implementing 6 app development practices.**

App downloads are definitely one of the key success metrics to track when developing a mobile health (mHealth) application. However, app downloads don’t provide the full picture. They should be complemented with the uninstallation rate.

A [survey](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8872344/) from 2022 shows that around half of the users of a healthcare mobile app will uninstall it within the next 30 days.

Although these numbers might alarm app owners, it's useful to consider some benchmarks. [The uninstall rate for Android apps generally falls between 40-50%](https://www.appsflyer.com/resources/reports/app-uninstall-benchmarks/). In this context, **healthcare apps don’t seem to deviate from the trend**. This is simply the nature of the app lifecycle. As noted in an article, more than half of all apps installed are uninstalled within 30 days of download.

So, is there anything we can do to reduce the user abandonment rate? Let’s explore the top solutions to prevent users from uninstalling your app.

## 1. User-Focused Marketing Campaign

It all starts way before the app installation. You plan a marketing budget for user acquisition, but do you truly understand your target group? If you target the campaign to the wrong users, they will install the app, realize it’s not for them, and uninstall it – yet you will still have to foot the bill for acquiring them. Verify your marketing campaign with your marketing team to ensure you're reaching the right target group.

## 2. Personalized onboarding

In mobile health apps, the onboarding process should emphasize personalized treatment for your users and show that you care about them. This is particularly important if your mHealth app is designed to assist users with chronic conditions that affect their everyday lives or significant life events such as pregnancy, postpartum, or menopause.

Explore [the case study of a FemTech app](/blog/data-driven-development-femtech-app-onboarding/) where simplifying and depersonalizing the onboarding process actually decreased the completion rate.

First interactions with the app are also crucial, as users admitted in the survey that they install several apps, compare them, and then keep only the best one:

## 3. Decisions based on data, not assumptions

This point ties directly into the previous one. Before launching your app, you should install analytics tools – ideally more than one for data comparison – to observe how users interact with the app, including during onboarding and with crucial features. Only then will you truly understand how your solution performs and be able to respond accordingly. This approach is known as data-driven development, and we strongly encourage you to introduce it to your software development team.

These are examples of metrics you should measure (apart from uninstallation rate):

## Inclusive AI

Another key reason for mHealth app uninstallation is that the app is 'not easy to use'. To address this, an inclusive UI can naturally attract users to your solution by immediately demonstrating the value of the mHealth app.

Understanding the User Persona is again a key! Before any mockups are developed, it’s wise to organize product workshops with your team to understand the end-users, benchmark your solutions against others, and establish core design principles.

A case study: An App for Individuals with Parkinson’s Disease

Designing an app for individuals suffering from Parkinson’s can be particularly challenging, as it must cater to users experiencing tremors and other movement disorders. Additionally, some users may be less tech-savvy. From the outset, it is crucial to design a UI that minimizes the potential for errors and, if an incorrect input does occur, easily allows the user to correct it.
