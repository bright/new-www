App downloads are definitely one of the key success metrics to track when developing a mobile health (mHealth) application. However, app downloads don’t provide the full picture. They should be complemented with the uninstallation rate.

A [survey](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8872344/) from 2022 shows that around half of the users of a healthcare mobile app will uninstall it within the next 30 days.

Although these numbers might alarm app owners, it's useful to consider some benchmarks. [The uninstall rate for Android apps generally falls between 40-50%](https://www.appsflyer.com/resources/reports/app-uninstall-benchmarks/). In this context, **healthcare apps don’t seem to deviate from the trend**. This is simply the nature of the app lifecycle. As noted in an article, more than half of all apps installed are uninstalled within 30 days of download.
