**You have an idea, design, and maybe even a software development team to build your mobile application. Still haven't you forgotten about something? What about establishing key targets that you want to achieve? Only then you can verify if your product is successful. Check out how to do that!**

<div class="image"><img src="/images/blogpost_mvp_success.png" alt="MVP success metrics" title="MVP success metrics"  /> </div>

Let’s assume that you chose an Agile way and decided to build [MVP (Minimum Viable Product)](/our-areas/mvp-development/), so you can quickly release your solution and verify it with users. While working on the MVP, **at the very beginning, you should establish your goals and ways to measure them**. Naturally, they can change as the product evolves and you gain a better understanding of the market.

## Examples of MVP success metrics

Here are some MVP success criteria for validation of your MVP, along with recommended tools to help measure them:

### Metric #1: App Download Rate

This metric is crucial for mobile MVPs and indicates how appealing your app is to users and whether your marketing efforts are effective.

To calculate the download rate, use the following formula:

<div class="important-info"><div>App Download Rate (%) = (D / C) x 100</div></div>

This formula measures the percentage of users who completed the download after clicking on the promotion.

Remember that downloading isn’t everything, though. [50% of Android apps are uninstalled within 30 days after the download](https://www.businessofapps.com/news/half-of-android-apps-are-uninstalled-within-30-days-after-download/). If your download rates are satisfactory but the number of active users is extremely low you might deal with a **high uninstalled rate**. 

That’s why the app download rate cannot be measured without the retention rate (keep on reading to discover that).

Tools to track app download rate: 

You can track app downloads using tools provided by well-known mobile app stores: **Google Play Console** for Android apps, and **App Store Connect** for iOS apps.

### Metric #2: User retention rate

It measures what **percentage of users continue to use your app after a given period** such as 30 days after app installation. User retention rate might be a crucial measurement to see if your product has loyal and engaged customers.

To calculate the user retention rate, you can use the following formula:

<div class="important-info"><div>User Retention Rate (%) = \\\\[(E - N) / S] x 100 </div></div>

Where:

E: The number of users at the end of a specific period (typically, this is the number of users who were active at the beginning of the period).

N: The number of new users acquired during that period.

S: The number of users at the start of the period.

**Tools to track user retention rate:** 

**Mixpanel, Firebase + Google Analytics** and **Amplitude** will be of help in measuring user retention rate.

### Metric #3: Churn rate

This metric **measures the percentage of users who uninstall or stop using your product** over a given period. It helps identify potential issues with your app that might be causing users to churn. 

To calculate the churn rate, you can use the following formula:

<div class="important-info"><div>Churn Rate (%) = (Customers at the Start of the Period - Customers at the End of the Period) / Customers at the Start of the Period </div></div>

There are many possible reasons why your users might delete your app or simply stop using it. The most common are:

* **Wrongly targeted or misleading ad campaigns** – users download the app only to realize that it’s not useful to them or it doesn’t offer what was promised.
* **UX issues** – your app is too difficult to navigate or not enough visually appealing.
* **Tech issues** – your app has performance issues, it frequently crashes, etc.
* **Too many notifications** – we all know that notifications are a powerful feature for mobile apps but be careful. With that power comes responsibility.
* **Too many ads** – what can we add here? Make your app worthy for users, then reasonably monetize. 😉

**Tools to measure churn rate**

Tools like **Mixpanel, Amplitude, or Kissmetrics** offer features to monitor and analyze churn rates.
