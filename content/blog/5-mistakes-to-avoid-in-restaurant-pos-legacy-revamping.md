**Your POS (Point of Sale) system has earned you loyal restaurant clients over the years. However, supporting new devices, third-party payments or refreshing outdated UI has become increasingly challenging. You know the time for POS legacy modernization is coming, but how can you achieve a smooth transition for your users? Based on our experience in Point of Sale revamping, we will share the mistakes you should avoid during restaurant POS legacy modernization.**

## Not prioritizing waitstaff feedback

**Joanna Cieszyńska, Product Designer @ bright inventions:**

When developing a POS system for waitstaff, it is crucial to consider their perspective. You shouldn't base your modernization solely on your internal vision of how the product should look. Instead, **rely on actual product design research techniques such as field studies, user shadowing, and adaptive interviews**.

Waitstaff are a very specific group of tech users; they have their habits, workarounds, and might know your POS even better than you do, using it in ways you wouldn't imagine. **A notable example we discovered during adaptive interviews involved users who didn’t use table maps but instead added notes to distinguish clients**, such as “lady with a yellow umbrella.” As you can see, that's a very specific way to use POS software. Ensure that your modernization is based on such feedback, so the transition to the new POS will be smoother for your users.

## Failing to balance perfection with progress

**Ariane Hinz, Project Manager @ bright inventions:**

In some cases, we tend to strive for perfection in our software, continually fine-tuning features and processes. However, at some point, **product owners should shift their focus from perfecting what users already love to further scaling the product**. 

Don't take this the wrong way – optimizing is always a key part of software development. But it's also important to **move forward and grow the product**. Focusing too much on already well-implemented parts of the system can slow down your scaling efforts.

As an example, let’s consider a highly appreciated feature by waitstaff: split payment. If initial feedback after the launch confirms that the feature is easy to use, fast, and helps avoid mistakes even when restaurant clients use different payment methods, then we can gladly build on it and implement already proven best practices while developing other features.

## Lack of adaptable features

**Szymon Gęsicki, Flutter Developer @ bright inventions:**

Some POS providers aim to address specific restaurant problems by offering unique, tailored features. While this individual approach is praiseworthy, **it is crucial to build features that are flexible and adaptable for other restaurants as well**. The ideal scenario is to create features that can be enabled or disabled according to every restaurant's needs.

**A great example is tailored prints for kitchen, accounting, or management**. Restaurants may have different needs regarding the type of receipts and fiscal documents they want to generate. It’s wise to keep this flexible so the **restaurant staff can adjust exactly what prints they need, rather than assuming everyone requires the same type of documents by default**.
