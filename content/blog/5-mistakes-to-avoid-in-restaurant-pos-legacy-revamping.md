## Not prioritizing waitstaff feedback

*When developing a POS system for waitstaff, it is crucial to consider their perspective. You shouldn't base your modernization solely on your internal vision of how the product should look. Instead, **rely on actual product design research techniques such as field studies, user shadowing, and adaptive interviews**.*

*Waitstaff are a very specific group of tech users; they have their habits, workarounds, and might know your POS even better than you do, using it in ways you wouldn't imagine. **A notable example we discovered during adaptive interviews involved users who didn’t use table maps but instead added notes to distinguish clients**, such as “lady with a yellow umbrella.” As you can see, that's a very specific way to use POS software. Ensure that your modernization is based on such feedback, so the transition to the new POS will be smoother for your users.*
