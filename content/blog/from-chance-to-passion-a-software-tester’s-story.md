**It’s not a typical tale about a career switch to a quality assurance specialist. Michał didn't plan to be a software tester; he was surprised by it yet couldn’t have embraced it better. Read his career story, learn what he’s eager to know about candidates during interviews as a recruiter, and discover how important hardware testing is in his job.**

## How did your software tester career kick off?

It was a total coincidence and a decision that wasn’t made by me. To give you a bigger picture, **I studied Management Engineering**, and as I approached graduation, I planned to become a business analyst or scrum master. I eventually landed a business analyst internship at a corporation in Gdańsk. Super excited about that, **I arrived on the first day only to be informed that there was a change of plans. It would be a software testing internship after all**.

## How did you react to that?

I was a bit surprised. Maybe back then, I wasn’t assertive enough, so I didn’t oppose the change. However, **I quickly started getting interesting tasks and soon found myself enjoying this new role**.

## What surprised you in a software tester role?

At first, the fact that it even exists! I mean, I was aware of the role in software development, but I never really thought about its purpose in the whole process. **I was certainly surprised by the amount of repetitive work related to it**. While some might find it boring, I somehow enjoy it. Of course, QA is not the only role that involves repetitive tasks; other professions, including programmers, also have to deal with that challenge.

## Is manual testing a profession that’s about to become extinct?

Absolutely not. **Both manual and automated testing have different responsibilities and complement each other**. Automated tests are mostly about regression tests and repetitive tasks, while manual testing focuses on new functionalities and exploratory testing.

## Okay, but what about AI? Will it replace testers?

Based on my experience, I don’t see that happening. I think that **there will actually be a greater need for testers to verify AI results**.

## How did you land at Bright Inventions?

It's all thanks to [Łukasz](/about-us/lukasz/), whom I have known for years. He works at Bright Inventions and had been convincing me for years to apply. **For a long time, I thought I couldn't possibly meet the requirements to join the company**. Obviously, **I now regret that hesitation because I really enjoy working here**.

## At Bright Inventions, you test software and its integrations with hardware. Tell us more about it.

Yes, **all my desk drawers are full of different devices, cables, trackers, and more**. While working at Bright Inventions, I had the opportunity to be part of various projects, including testing a POS application with multiple devices such as printers, terminals, and POS monitors. 

Currently, **I am part of a team developing an IoT solution based on a network of bluetooth trackers which is mostly used for device tracking**. The number of usages is almost limitless and it can serve in healthcare, supply chains, or cold delivery chains for example. 

**Working with Bluetooth is very specific and differs significantly from testing web or typical mobile apps**. It's a truly developmental experience because you must anticipate many factors, such as the impact of wireless headphones connected to a phone on the entire application's operation. It also allows me to conduct some tests outdoors, providing a welcome break from sitting in front of the computer all the time.

## As a tech recruiter, what do you expect from candidates?

**I seek people who truly understand what they say they do**. Sometimes, when you learn from a tutorial, you might grasp a framework like Cypress for test automation but not fully understand what automation is all about.

I also look for **people who know how to work with software developers** because it can be quite challenging. That’s why soft skills are essential. I usually ask candidates about their experience with cooperation with developers **checking their proactivity, assertiveness, and empathy**.

## What is your after-hours hobby?

Since I was a child, **I've always enjoyed assembling Lego**.

Now that I have a three-year-old, I can go to the store and pretend that the Lego is only for him.  I mostly buy Lego City sets – my son is excited about all the vehicles, and I get to assemble the bricks. It's a win-win!
