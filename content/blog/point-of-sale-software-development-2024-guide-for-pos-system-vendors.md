## Point of sale system definition

A P**oint-of-Sale (POS) system is a combination of hardware and software** that facilitates sales transactions and manages business operations in **retail, hospitality**, and other industries. It includes **devices like thermal printers, POS terminals, desktop and mobile POS systems**, enabling businesses to process payments, track inventory, and manage orders.

**POS system development can be tailored to meet specific needs** such as supporting old desktop hardware which may be still used by end users, especially in hospitality. Point-of-sale software's main functionality is ensuring **a smooth connection between hardware and software components**.

## Key features to include in modern POS software development

POS systems are versatile solutions that **consist of dozens of features, additional applications, and POS hardware**, forming the technological backbone for managing client orders in restaurants, hotels, and retail settings.

### Examples of must-have features in a POS System

* **Inventory Management**: Track stock levels, reduce waste, and reorder automatically.
* **Integrations**: Connect with POS hardware (printers, card readers) and third-party services.
* **Z-Report and X-Report**: Essential for daily financial summaries and cash register audits.
* **Check-in/Check-out**: Manage employee time tracking efficiently.
* **Payment Processing**: Accept various payment types.
* **Order Management**: Handle bundles, variants, and customizations.
* **Table Management**: Organize seating with a visual floor plan.
* **Digital Ordering**: Enable online orders.
* **Payment Split**: Allow customers to split payments.
* **Notes for Kitchen**: Special instructions for orders.
* **Reporting & Analytics**: Real-time data for business insights.

### Extra POS solution Features for POS application Differentiation

* **Splitting the Bill**: Divide the bill between guests.
* **Kitchen Display System**: Digital kitchen orders.

## Developing a POS: Cloud POS or On-premise POS

Cloud POS and on-premise POS systems differ in their infrastructure and setup. **A cloud POS operates through the internet, offering flexibility, remote access, and automatic updates**. It's easier to scale but **requires a reliable internet connection which can be an issue in restaurant or hotel environments**. 

On the other hand, **traditional POS involves hosting software and hardware locally**, which gives businesses more control but requires regular maintenance and **higher costs**.

When you build a POS system, consider business needs: cloud POS excels in flexibility and usually lower costs, while on-premise POS offers better control and offline POS capabilities.
