DesignRush is a marketplace that connects clients with professional agencies specialising in software development, marketing and design. Design Rush regularly publishes rankings presenting top global service providers.

**We are extremely happy that [Bright Inventions blockchain services](/our-areas/blockchain) have been recognised by Design Rush representatives.** Blockchain development is a very crucial technology for our team.

Bright Inventions team specialises in delivering blockchain projects. **We have been entrusted with a major Ethereum blockchain for a social impact project** – a global food assistance program. 

Furthermore, we cooperate with Polkadot and Kusama networks built around Substrate. **We have been developing our own project funded by a W3F Foundation grant. [Bright Treasury](/blog/bright-treasury-a-treasury-module-application-funded-by-a-w3f-foundation-grant/) is a standalone web application (along with a PWA representation) that will allow performing basic actions on the Treasury and Bounties modules** of Polkadot and Kusama Substrate networks, and hopefully encourage more people to get involved in these blockchain communities.

We are happy that our efforts in terms of sharing knowledge about blockchain and making this technology more accessible have been noticed.
