Who would not like to be successful and manage their time wisely to have it for everything and for everyone? We all would. But to do that we should focus on our life for a bit longer than few seconds and think which elements of it make us less effective, and in consequence less happy. We should focus on recovering.

If we decide to recover, we should always keep in mind that our life is not a sprint. Real success is growing slowly and sustainably. Every step is well-planned and make us closer to our goal. So let us project it attentively. It will leave us stronger and more single-minded than ever. 

We also have to learn that a success is not something magical or mysterious. **Success is a natural consequence of learning, seeking new opportunities and putting our plans into action. And recovering is an indispensable part of each and every success.** The more ordinary we want to be and the more common our choices are, the farther from recovering we are. Extraordinary people seek education and learning. Extraordinary people recover from their life. 

## **1) Complaining** 

Grumbling, moaning, criticising. We very often demotivate ourselves just by complaining. And complaining is passive. Unless it is not contagious with constructive criticism, complaining has no value. We should always think twice and raise a question if it may change anything before we start complaining about something. 

## **2) Obstinacy** 

Our ideas are not always the best ones. Flexibility and open-mindedness are two things people pay most for these days. Let us not stick to our original plan just because it is original and it is ours. Stubbornly following own plan while someone is suggesting a change would lead us nowhere. Obstinacy does not help, it just closes our mind. 

## **3) Humility and Gratitude** 

There is not much to say about that. Just everyone should know what these two are. Let us be grateful for what we have. Let us appreciate our work, our families, our life. And let us be aware of the fact that we are not perfect. Showing a little humility has never killed anyone. 

## **4) Being busy**

Being busy all the time will not make us more effective and efficient. Spending 10 hours doing tasks instead of 6 does not mean that they will be completed in a better manner. We all know that mental job is taxing, but we have just a few hours each day during which we can be genuinely concentrated, so let us optimise this time and get the most of it. It is not about being busy, but about being absorbed in what we do. 

## **5) Other People** 

Schedule time for yourself. It can be 10 minutes, 50 minutes or 2 hours - depending on your needs.  This is time for us to ponder, to plan, to reflect on our life. It is our quality time. And everyone needs that. If you think you do not - you may need it even more. People need time alone, without others. Solitude now and then is nothing wrong. Solitude can cure what troubles and afflicts us. 

## **6) Demanding** 

We do not deserve everything, so let us not demand everything. We are getting used to getting  everything what we want. But do we always earn it? Why we should be given everything on a plate? The most successful individuals earn their success by working hard, and by working with great people. The only thing they demand are opportunities. 

**If we want to achieve a success, we have to recover, recover from complaining, demanding, boasting, overworking.** We have to invest in self-education and refuse to tolerate mediocrity. And probably Paulo Coelho has already said all that, but does it mean he was wrong?
