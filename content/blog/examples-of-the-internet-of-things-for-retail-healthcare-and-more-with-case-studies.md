## IoT for retail and restaurants

The Internet of Things is greatly utilized in the retail and restaurant industry. A perfect example is the **point of sales system which enables a customer to check out at a store or cafe**.

Let’s think about typical devices you could find while checking out in a restaurant. They, in fact, create an **IoT retail network**. There is a Point of Sale desktop (this huge screen that might divide you and a cashier in the restaurant). It's a core of the retail IoT network. **POS desktop** **with a dedicated app** enables one to sum up all clients' orders and send the information about the final costs to the **receipt printer** as well as to the **payment terminal**. 

<div className="image">![IoT POS for retail, restaurants](../../static/images/iot_retail_epos.png "IoT POS for retail, restaurants")</div>

All of these devices have to be **connected with Bluetooth or WiFi** to enable checkout in every restaurant and practically at every retail business. It wouldn’t happen without IoT.

The fact that you pay with your card and then receive a printed receipt means that you are a “beneficiary” of a retail Internet of Things technology.

**Check out an actual case study – [Just Eat POS applications](/projects/system-for-restaurants) that we built and scaled.**

## IoT for healthcare

Healthcare is an industry where IoT can support the prevention of many illnesses, especially cardiovascular diseases which are the [leading cause of death](https://www.who.int/health-topics/cardiovascular-diseases#tab=tab_1) globally. As an example of healthcare IoT check out a possible **network of a mobile phone, with a dedicated application, connected to eHealth devices** that send data to the app.

<div className="image">![IoT for healthcare](../../static/images/iot_in_healthcare.png "IoT for healthcare")</div>

This IoT network consists of a **thermometer** that measures the body’s temperature and thanks to a Bluetooth connection sends it to the app. The **spirometer** checks the respiration rate and sends data to the app too. Also, we have a **pulse oximeter** that sends data about heart rate. 

The app and modern eHealth devices create a **healthcare IoT network that measures patients' vital signs and processes them in the app**. Now, the **app could send data to a designated doctor who can immediately verify the state of a patient**. IoT is definitely the future of healthcare. Or even the present because that technology already exists!

**Check out an actual case study – [vCare healthcare application](/projects/vCare) that we helped to develop.**

## IoT in sports

The network of devices connected with apps is quite known for athletes. Anyone can wear a **smartwatch to measure heart rate, burned calories**, and other data that are transferred to our phones and then we can analyze them. That also is the Internet of Things. 

Gathered data might be similar to the one processed by healthcare IoT systems but the way we utilize the data may vary. According to data collected and analyzed with IoT apps and devices **athletes and coaches can plan workouts, establish dietary requirements**, and more. This can be managed by an IoT sports app built for specific disciplines such as cycling, running, or swimming.

**Check out an actual case study – [Motivo application for cyclists](/projects/motivo) that we developed.**

## IoT for emergency services

Imagine an app that can send your localization, in emergency situations, to rescue services and close ones. Actually, you don’t need to imagine that. This is possible thanks to IoT.

You don’t have to make a call, pushing one button on your phone would start it all. An **IoT app connects you with chosen devices and emergency services to send SOS messages**.

**Check out an actual case study – [SmartHelp emergency application](/projects/smarthelp) that we developed.**
