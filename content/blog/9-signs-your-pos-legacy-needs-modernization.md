**From risky cloud migration to the constant struggle of supporting various devices, 3rd party payments, and multiple food delivery platforms‚Ä¶ Does your POS (Point of Sale) development team fight with any of these challenges? Perhaps it‚Äôs time for your POS legacy to be revamped. Answer these questions to find out!**

<div className="image">![legacy POS revamping](/images/pos_revamping_signs_blog_cover.png "legacy POS revamping")</div>

## Do you face difficulties in integrating food delivery platforms with your POS?

**Multiple tablets for multiple food delivery platforms‚Ä¶** That‚Äôs the nightmare of many restaurant staff. Integrating all external providers and unifying them into a system accessible on one device is possible! Yet is your POS capable of offering that?

## Is your POS based solely on desktop devices?

Modern POS is often a **combined system of desktop and mobile handheld devices** e.g. tablet &  smartphone terminals, or portable card readers. Can a variety of devices be integrated into your POS?

## Is your POS on-premise although you wish for cloud migration?

Do you still manage servers on your own, at the same time considering a move to cloud-based services to reduce costs? **The age of your system can significantly complicate migration efforts**. Revamping your POS system could be a strategic move towards a more budget-friendly migration. By updating your technology, you can avoid compatibility issues with cloud platforms and legacy technologies, and minimize any downtime that could affect your customers.

## Do you face the challenge of the rising number of payment terminals?

The number of devices, especially payment terminals is growing and your legacy has limitations related to the number of terminals it can support. **Do you constantly look for workarounds to deal with this challenge, feeling pressure from your clients**?

## Do you support various payment options, including loyalty cards?

You might be operating in a market with a strong culture of loyalty programs, yet find that **your legacy POS system struggles to accommodate the evolving loyalty solutions** offered by various business partners.

## Do you struggle with acquiring new clients and keeping current ones?

Have you received **feedback from prospects and actual clients that your legacy system is outdated**, lacking the user experience and features compared to the competition?

## Is it hard to find software developers who can handle the technologies your POS system uses?

Is your POS **based on technologies that are not popular anymore or haven‚Äôt been upgraded for years** (such as Visual Basic)? Is **onboarding new developers lengthy and difficult** due to a lot of ‚Äútribal knowledge‚Äù residing within individual employees or simply missing?

## How often do you have to put the fires in production?

**How frequently do you address critical issues in production**, such as payment processing failures, orders not reaching the kitchen, or features like bill sorting and modifications not working, forcing you to prioritize these urgent fixes? Also, **are your developers hesitant to make changes in production** due to insufficient automated testing and a lack of comprehensive system knowledge?

## Last but not least‚Ä¶ Is your POS legacy system as old as some of the developers working on it? üòâ

Are you continuing to develop a system that's been decades in the making? **Is it finally time to build the new version** and ensure (with backward compatibility) a smooth transition for your clients?
