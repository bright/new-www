As a [GdaÅ„sk-based software development studio](/our-areas/gdansk-software-company/), we've always valued the fact that Infoshare â€“ the biggest tech and startup event in Central and Eastern Europe â€“ takes place in GdaÅ„sk. The 2024 edition of the event will be held on May 22-23 at AmberExpo. Once again, our team is looking forward to attending. Curious about what's on our bucket list for the event?

## Networking
