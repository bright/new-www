As a [Gdańsk-based software development studio](/our-areas/gdansk-software-company/), we've always valued the fact that Infoshare – the biggest tech and startup event in Central and Eastern Europe – takes place in Gdańsk. The 2024 edition of the event will be held on May 22-23 at AmberExpo. Once again, our team is looking forward to attending. Curious about what's on our bucket list for the event?

## Networking

We can't wait to meet other innovators coming to Gdańsk for Infoshare, particularly representatives from tech startups and MSEs. We're eager to learn about your solutions or ideas for applications.
