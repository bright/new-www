## **Mobile applications, Blockchain and...**

Bright Inventions was established in 2012 in Gdańsk. **We started with creating mobile and web applications, but we also specialise in system integrations as well as IoT, and have experience with Blockchain-based app platforms (Ethereum and Hyperledger).** We support a wide variety of clients from such sectors as FinTech, Health, Automotive, Commerce/Shopping and others and our services have been found superior in Germany, Norway, the Netherlands, UK and Israel. Since 2012 we have learnt the value of interesting technically challenging projects and become quite picky in terms of the ones we select (you can read more about our projects [HERE.](https://clutch.co/profile/bright-inventions)). Now we want the evolution of Bright pick up the pace. We already have about 20 passionate professionals working for clients all over the world, yet we would like to capture new opportunities and that is why we need a great ambitious person just like you. 

## **Personal Growth and Passion** 

Our passion for work is visible in every phase of the project. While dealing with a variety of clients from startups to consulting and interactive agencies we have learnt that an individual and transparent attitude about a multitude of options we have, allows us to maximise the value of our clients' products.  We pay special attention to selecting the appropriate technology stack that will not only support client’s solution, but also make our team develop their skills.  We will never let you get bored. **We focus on self-development as we feel that is the key to build a satisfied and engaged team.** If you are a person who would like to achieve flow in programming and feel comfortable with switching between technologies, Bright Inventions is the place for you. Along the way you can learn a lot of and focus on many problems at hand. 

## **Best People and Best Practices** 

Are we another big software company? Definitely, not. We create a team of talented developers who value and apply the best programming practices, the team in which everyone is an important and integral part of the company, not an anonymous entity. We work with computers, but we hire people not machines. On a daily basis we try to follow such techniques and processes as **Pair Programming, Code review, TDD or Continuous integration.** We deeply believe that our client’s ideas deserve a great code and great people. If you have a passion to deliver and you would like to enhance your skills, you will definitely find a place among us. It doesn’t matter whether you are a junior looking for the first experience or a senior with a wide expertise, what matters is your  attitude, open mind and eagerness to learn. If you have it, and you enjoy startup organisational culture with flat structure and no management overhead, it may mean you will be a great fit for us.

So, are you ready to apply and join our Bright Team? If so, let us look what we will expect from you. These are universal requirements for all developer’s openings at Bright Inventions.
