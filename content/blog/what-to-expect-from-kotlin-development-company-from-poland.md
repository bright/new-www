## What does the Kotlin development company do?

[Kotlin development agency](/our-areas/mobile-app-development) specializes in building and maintaining mobile applications for Android. Kotlin developers take care of every aspect of the Android app development process: from the ideation phase to the launch and maintenance. 

The main programming languages used to build Android apps are Java and Kotlin. At Bright Inventions, we use Kotlin because it is a more modern language. It offers more effective ways to deliver high-quality code specifically for Android applications.

Polish Kotlin Developers are well-known for their great expertise, responsibility and delivering high-quality solutions.

### 2. Polish software developers communicate fluently in English

Polish developers speak fluently in English on daily basis. In the [EF English Proficiency Index](https://www.ef.com/assetscdn/WIBIwq6RdJvcD9bc8RMd/cefcom-epi-site/reports/2021/ef-epi-2021-english.pdf) Poland was ranked in the top of countries with high proficiency in English.

### 3. Poland has one of the biggest numbers of female software developers

It is still not enough. Yet, [compared to the rest of the world](https://blog.hackerrank.com/which-countries-have-the-most-skilled-female-developers/) that is an impressive number. Moreover, [half of the Polish scientists are women](https://www.thefirstnews.com/article/breaking-the-glass-ceiling-when-it-comes-to-science-polish-women-are-on-the-up-10422).

### 4. Workable time difference between Polish Kotlin developers and the rest of the world

Poland is in Central European Time (CET) which makes it possible to organise daily online meetings with companies from Germany, Norway, as well as Israel or the USA.

**Examples of time differences:**

🇵🇱  Poland – 🇩🇪 Germany: no time difference

🇵🇱  Poland – 🇳🇴 Norway: no time difference

🇵🇱  Poland – 🇬🇧  the UK: 1-hour time difference

🇵🇱  Poland – 🇮🇱 Israel: 1-hour time difference

🇵🇱  Poland – 🇺🇸 New York: 6-hours time difference

For example, staying in New York you can organise a daily meeting at 9.00 AM local time. At the same time, in Poland it will be 3.00 PM – a perfect time after lunch. Kotlin developers in Poland usually finish their work between 4-6 PM.
