## About Forbes Diamonds 

The Forbes Diamond stands as a prestigious accolade for the most dynamically evolving private companies in Poland. Collaboratively curated by the Forbes editorial team and Dun & Bradstreet Poland, the list of "Diamonds" comprises companies that have experienced the most rapid increase in value over the last three years. To earn the Forbes Diamond, companies must demonstrate a positive financial outcome, with a cooperation risk factor higher than 4, as evaluated by the Dun & Bradstreet Poland rating.

## Our bright DNA

Since the founding of the company in 2012 we have already implemented dozens of innovative projects, ranging from monitoring athletes' activities, smart home solutions, payment systems, logistics support tools, to emergency notification systems assisting in handling emergency hotline calls in critical situations. **However, Bright Inventions, apart from innovative and reliable solutions, is above all about creative individuals and long-term relationships.**

For many years, a clear and dynamic work culture has been shaping here, breaking the mould of traditional tech companies. **Bright Inventions is, above all, a team – not a random group of engineers but a community of true enthusiasts collaborating for many years.** **The values like responsibility, flexibility, a positive approach, and a strong customer focus accompany team members in every aspect of the company's operations, from recruitment activities and project management to client communication.**

## Our strategic focus

We have extensive experience in modernizing and rescuing systems that are not compatible with user needs or market demands. **It happens that we take on endangered projects facing imminent issues of instability and performance.** Information systems created by our team straightforwardly deliver advanced functionalities to users. Providing high-quality services and cultivating long-term relationships with clients pays off in trust and long-term collaboration. 

**In 2022 Bright Inventions became a part of the Scandinavian [Lyvia Group](https://lyviagroup.com/), aiming for integrated collaboration among the best providers of digital solutions**. As a part of the broader universe we have the opportunity to modernize the digital landscape worldwide, ensuring that digitization becomes a natural part of every organization striving for continuous development.

We believe that every challenge is an opportunity to innovate and learn. Join us on this exciting journey towards a future where technology not only meets but exceeds expectations. Together we can create software that really matters in the today's world.
