## Meet our speakers

4 speakers will share AWS insights with attendees:

### [Piotr Mionskowski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/piotr-mionskowski-b2858516/), Partner and Team Leader @ Bright Inventions

<div className="image">![Piotr Mionskowski AWS Tricity](../../static/images/aws_tricity_speaker_piotr.png "Piotr Mionskowski AWS Tricity")</div>

Piotr is a senior fullstack developer and tech lead with over 12 years of professional experience in backend APIs, distributed systems, backend frameworks, and databases. He possesses an exceptional ability to learn almost every new technology that appears. Always up-to-date. Always focused.

Piotr has mastered the art of writing SOLID code and finding the answers to the most unexpected problems. Keeping a client's product operational and running is always of huge importance. He sometimes called himself “A Man Dancing with the Code” because for him programming does not come down to writing code. It is something more – it is an art in which programmers are sculptors who always should ask the question “Why”. A great fan of TDD and pair programming.

More o his presentation:

**OpenTelemetry**

OpenTelemetry enables new opportunities for monitoring production systems. With a set of standardized APIs, we can decouple our systems from monitoring products and have a common language to speak cross-platforms. I’m going to talk & demonstrate where Opentelemetry shines and where we should look for a different tool.

### [Paweł Piwosz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pawelpiwosz), DevOps Institute Ambassador, AWS Community Builder & CD.Foundation Ambassador

<div className="image">![Paweł Piwosz AWS Tricity](../../static/images/aws_tricity_speaker_pawel.png "Paweł Piwosz AWS Tricity")</div>

DevOps, leader, mentor, trainer. His main focus in DevOps is CALMS as a framework. He tries to build a better understanding of DevOps as a company’s “driving force”.

More on his presentation:

**Start your journey with AWS - the good, the bad and the ugly**

The story is about whether migration to AWS (or any cloud in general) is a solution to all problems. What are the things we need to have under control, so we won’t be surprised by an extremely high invoice from AWS? Or what’s worst - by a “request” from a hacker for some bitcoins.

### [Somanath Dange](https://www.linkedin.com/in/somanath-dange/), DevOps Consultant @ Amazon Web Services
