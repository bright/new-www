**Following [part 1 of our guide on how to support Web3](/blog/how-to-contribute-to-kusama-and-polkadot-part-1) if you are not a software developer, we are coming to you with other ideas. Check them out, find ones that suit you well, and be a part of the Web3 revolution.** 😉

## Make videos for the Kusama and Polkadot communities

According to Google Trends, YouTube users as well as Google searchers also started to be more interested in all Web3 things. 😉 If you are a YouTuber or aspire to be one – you might consider creating content about Web3.

Also, if your video can be of value to the community, you can submit an idea for it on BrightTreasury. If the community appreciates your creative plans, you can turn them into a proposal and get funds to cover your expenses.

**Example of proposal for video production:**

## Appreciate others with Treasury tips

Have you noticed someone’s great contribution and you believe they should be recognized and rewarded? **You can suggest someone from the community who deserves to receive a tip paid in $KSM or $DOT**. After that, the council decides on the amount of the tip. The easiest way to suggest a tip beneficiary is via [BrightTreasury's Tips Module](https://treasury.bright.dev/tips/?utm_source=brightinventions_blog&utm_medium=link_article&utm_campaign=contributetoweb3_2&utm_id=content_marketing).



## Provide feedback for Kusama and Polkadot applications

When someone contributes to Polkadot and Kusama nets, they often need one thing – feedback. As a potential user, your thoughts on the planned and existing solutions are precious. We encourage you to **leave feedback for community creators whether they have built a plugin or published some educational content**. 

You can even discuss their ideas on [BrightTreasury](https://treasury.bright.dev/?utm_source=brightinventions_blog&utm_medium=link_article&utm_campaign=contributetoweb3_2&utm_id=content_marketing) before they turn them into a proposal. Let them know if their idea can be of use or maybe it shouldn't be developed because something similar already exists. Don't be a silent member. Contribute by using your voice!

**We hope that you have got inspired to contribute to the community. See you on the Web3 path!**
