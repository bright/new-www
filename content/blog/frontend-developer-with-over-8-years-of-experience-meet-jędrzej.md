## You are a frontend developer. Is the backend totally strange to you?

No. **I used to work as a fullstack developer and I worked with servers as well**. I have no problem going to “the other side” as long as I am familiar with the backend stack used in a project I work on.

## How long do you work as a software developer? How do you recall the beginnings of your career?

I have over **8 years of commercial experience**. My first job started as an internship. I was a part of the internal team which had an ambitious goal to build a to-do list application. **I wrote the backend in PHP with Symfony** which is a hardcore framework with a high entry threshold. 

Eventually, I was offered a full-time job. **I started to learn Angular** which was something new back then. After that, **I turned to React and have been working with this framework for the past 5 years**.

## What is your advice to people who want to become junior frontend developers?

It’s hard to say because as you know I started to work in this industry years ago. I guess my career began when there weren’t so many frameworks available. So I naturally focused on getting to know the language. That’s what I would recommend to future frontend developers. **Focus on understanding the language, not only frameworks**. Language is the basic tool you are going to work with, so don’t neglect it. Also, you should **understand the basics of algorithms and software design patterns**.
