Szymon Chmal is a senior frontend developer. He’s in love with React, but open to new technologies regarding both frontend and backend areas. Technology is for him just a tool used to provide business value to software products he is working on. 

Before conquering the 4developers stage Szymon will have two presentations at another IT event [Warsaw IT Days](/blog/szymon-chmal-from-bright-inventions-among-warsaw-it-days-speakers). Busy days are ahead of him. 🙂
