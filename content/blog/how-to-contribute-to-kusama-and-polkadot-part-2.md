Also, if your video can be of value to the community, you can submit an idea for it on BrightTreasury. If the community appreciates your creative plans, you can turn them into a proposal and get funds to cover your expenses.

## Appreciate others with Treasury tips

Have you noticed someoneâ€™s great contribution and you believe they should be recognized and rewarded? **You can suggest someone from the community who deserves to receive a tip paid in $KSM or $DOT**. After that, the council decides on the amount of the tip. The easiest way to suggest a tip beneficiary is via BrightTreasury's Tips Module.

## Provide feedback for Kusama and Polkadot applications

When someone contributes to Polkadot and Kusama nets, they often need one thing â€“ feedback. As a potential user, your thoughts on the planned and existing solutions are precious. We encourage you to **leave feedback for community creators whether they have built a plugin or published some educational content**. 

You can even discuss their ideas on BrightTreasury before they turn them into a proposal. Let them know if their idea can be of use or maybe it shouldn't be developed because something similar already exists. Don't be a silent member. Contribute by using your voice!

**We hope that you have got inspired to contribute to the community. See you on the Web3 path!**
