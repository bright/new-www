We want to show our support to the Ukrainian people - their spirit and the bravery they are showing - amidst this horrifying attack. According to United Nations refugee agency has reported [over 1.7 million people](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/ukraine/location?secret=unhcrrestricted) from Ukraine have become refugees. As with any crisis, women, children, poor communities will be those most affected. When watching the war scenes it is easy to feel feeble and weak, but we believe that together we can help Ukraine in any way we can. 

## **\#PomagamUkrainie** 

One of the best ways to help is by donating money through trusted charities and aid organisations as well as donating goods in your local collection points. 

Currently, humanitarian assistance on the territory of Poland is provided under the Polish government coordination mechanism: [www.pomagamukrainie.gov.pl](https://www.pomagamukrainie.gov.pl/).

One of the main priorities for the provision of assistance is its effectiveness in reaching the largest possible group of people in need and meeting their specific needs as efficiently as possible, taking into account the dynamics of the conflict itself and the situation of the people affected.

## **[\#TechForUkraine ](https://www.techtotherescue.org/tech/tech-for-ukraine)**

NGOs are at the heart of civil society in Ukraine. While the the age of digitization has dawned, charities are still far behind private businesses and state institutions. Weak security systems, outdated software and a lack of user-friendly UI and UX make it difficult for them to operate.

**We have joined the initiative and so can you. How you can help?**

1. Take the pledge - decide whether you want to provide Custom software development, take part in a 2-week Sprint for impact (27.03-08.04) or pledge your time to providemeaningful consulting for non-profits.
2. Select the projects of your interest - declare in what kind of projects would you like to participate in - define your problem and tech preference. We will get back to you with a list of potential projects that you could support.
3. Get matched and start building a project - participate in a Matching Call where you will get to meet the non-profit team and check if there is a spark for a joint project. If yes then all there is left is to participate in a scoping session and you are good to go!

## **Fight misinformation** 

We should do everything we can to support the citizens of Ukraine in this terrible situation. We believe that we should listen to the voice of the Ukrainians themselves and help them in their time of need. Apart from financial and material support we can should also fight disinformation, so please check facts and use reliable sources of information before you share them with others.
