**He left a successful career in civil engineering to join the world of software development, hoping that every new day would bring interesting problems to solve. He wasn’t disappointed! Discover what civil engineering and IT have in common, how software developers build trust with their code, and which book he recommends – though with a cautionary note. It’s time for the career story of Dominik, Senior Fullstack Developer at Bright Inventions.**

## When did you write your first "Hello world"?

It was in high school, **in the early 2000s**. Our computer science teacher tried to teach us some programming. The classes inspired me to explore the subject at home, so I asked my dad if he had any resources because he was keen on computers. 

He gave me a rather thick book about Visual Basic, and I managed to create two applications that actually worked. In the meantime, I dabbled in creating simple websites, mostly blog templates, because back then, having a blog was a sign of being a respectable person on the internet. :) However, at some point, **I got bored of it and put programming on hold for another twelve years**. At some point, I even thought about applying to computer science studies, but my grades weren't sufficient, so I studied civil engineering instead and pursued a career in this field.

## How long did you work in civil engineering before joining the IT world?

**I worked at a planning and design firm for 10 years**. However, after 9 years, I felt I had enough and needed a change. Since programming had always interested me, I decided to try to learn it on my own after hours. It was a risk, but fortunately, it paid off. At that time, **many people questioned why I would want to change my stable career, especially after turning 30**. I’m glad it turned out well for me.

## Do you miss civil engineering?

Not at all.

## Okay, but did this previous career help you in software development?

Yes, in some sense the principles are the same – **both civil engineering and software development are about problem-solving**. The difference is that as your expertise grows in construction, you accumulate solutions for problems you face, and are ready to tackle most of them. **In software development, even with years of experience, you can still encounter issues that will keep you on your toes for days**.
