Apart from using Swift language iOS developers use lots of other technologies including libraries, frameworks and more.

We have listed a typical stack used by iOS developers from Bright Inventions:

## Reasons why you should work with an iOS development team from Poland:

### 1. Polish software developers are a global top of the top.

It has been a well-known fact for years. In 2016 [](https://blog.hackerrank.com/which-country-would-win-in-the-programming-olympics/)[HackerRank](https://blog.hackerrank.com/which-country-would-win-in-the-programming-olympics/) presented a very popular insight “Which Country Would Win in the Programming Olympics?”. The report was widely referenced on multiple sites. Polish software developers took third place!

### 2. Polish software developers communicate fluently in English.

Polish developers speak fluently in English on a daily basis. In the [EF English Proficiency Index Poland](https://www.ef.com/assetscdn/WIBIwq6RdJvcD9bc8RMd/cefcom-epi-site/reports/2021/ef-epi-2021-english.pdf) was ranked in the top of countries with high proficiency in English.

### 3. Poland has one of the biggest numbers of female software developers.

Poland has challenged gender inequalities in software development. [HackerRank](https://blog.hackerrank.com/which-countries-have-the-most-skilled-female-developers/) listed Poland at the top of countries with the largest proportion of female developers. Obviously, there is still a lot to be done for women in tech but compared to many other countries you can see the difference.

### 4. Workable time difference between Polish Swift developers and the rest of the world.

Poland is in Central European Time (CET) which makes it possible to organize daily online meetings with companies from Germany, Norway, as well as Israel or the USA.
