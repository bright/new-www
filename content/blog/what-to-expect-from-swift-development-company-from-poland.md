## Reasons why you should work with an iOS development team from Poland:

### 1. Polish software developers are a global top of the top.

It has been a well-known fact for years. In 2016 [HackerRank](https://blog.hackerrank.com/which-country-would-win-in-the-programming-olympics/) presented a very popular insight “Which Country Would Win in the Programming Olympics?”. The report was widely referenced on multiple sites. Polish software developers took third place!

### 2. Polish software developers communicate fluently in English.

Polish developers speak fluently in English on a daily basis. In the [EF English Proficiency Index Poland](https://www.ef.com/assetscdn/WIBIwq6RdJvcD9bc8RMd/cefcom-epi-site/reports/2021/ef-epi-2021-english.pdf) was ranked in the top of countries with high proficiency in English.

### 3. Poland has one of the biggest numbers of female software developers.

Poland has challenged gender inequalities in software development. [HackerRank](https://blog.hackerrank.com/which-countries-have-the-most-skilled-female-developers/) listed Poland at the top of countries with the largest proportion of female developers. Obviously, there is still a lot to be done for women in tech but compared to many other countries you can see the difference.
