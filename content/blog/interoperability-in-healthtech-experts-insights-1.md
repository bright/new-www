**Healthcare has long been entangled with inefficiencies, and much like a patient in a maze of endless hospital corridors, it often suffers from a lack of direction—specifically, the lack of interoperability among diverse [Electronic Health Record (EHR)](https://www.ama-assn.org/topics/electronic-health-records-ehr) systems. As more universal standards are introduced to resolve the issues of competing existing standards, the end result is often just an increase in the number of competing standards.** **This cycle highlights the challenge of achieving true interoperability in healthcare, where the goal to streamline and unify data exchange across systems frequently leads to more complexity rather than less.**

\
Interoperability, or the ability for health IT systems to talk to each other without needing a translator, is now recognized as **a crucial ingredient for the smooth operation of future healthcare systems**.\
\
This article draws on some insights from the industry experts at the [2024 HLTH Europe Conference](https://europe.hlth.com/) and includes valuable perspectives from our team of specialists in [telemedicine app development](/our-areas/healthcare-software-development/).

## The importance of interoperability in healthcare

Interoperability in healthcare is like having a universal remote for every gadget in your home. **Dr Adam Brown from ABIG Health** highlights its necessity, stating, "*The ability for different systems to communicate has a profound impact on patients getting the right care*", emphasizing that interoperability is as crucial as having a good WiFi signal during a Netflix watch. 

## Issues with disparate EHR systems

When EHR systems don’t communicate, it's like each department in a hospital using a different dialect of a language. The lack of seamless communication can lead to redundant tests and medical errors—because nothing says "inefficiency" like having three different radiologists give you three different opinions on the same Xray.

## Benefits of seamless data sharing

Seamless data sharing offers benefits that are as clear as a well-organized spreadsheet. **Dr Brown** further explains, "*Interoperability benefits patients by improving quality and reducing costs*," similar to catching a pricing error in your favor at checkout​. For patients, this means less time recounting their medical history and more time discussing e.g. their weekend plans.

## **General agreement on the necessity of interoperability**

The necessity of interoperability is widely acknowledged across the healthcare industry. As stated in insights gathered from healthcare professionals, "*the technology breaks down a lot of \[administrative barriers] and presents a completely different way of thinking about healthcare,*" - says **Aahuti Rai, Strategic Advisor at Four Points Consulting**. The interest in interoperability is inspiring and fosters hope for the future.

## Trends in healthcare interoperability

The industry is moving towards an integrated model where systems not only exist side by side but also work together to ensure better patient care, similar to assembling a team of superheroes each with a unique power. While initiatives like [Nuria](https://nuria.com.br/) in Brazil and [Patients Know Best](https://patientsknowbest.com/) in the UK focus on enhancing patient engagement by **allowing individuals to manage their health information across various platforms**, solutions like [Leyr](https://leyr.io/) operate at a foundational level. Leyr serves as **a robust framework designed to tackle the complexities of integrating diverse healthcare systems**. This tool exemplifies the critical role of foundational technologies in achieving interoperability, facilitating seamless data exchanges that are vital for comprehensive care management.

## Challenges of implementing interoperability in HealthTech

“*Implementing interoperability in healthcare is fraught with challenges*” - states **Maciej Nawrocki, Senior Backend Developer at Bright Inventions** - The complexity of modern data standards like [Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)](https://ecqi.healthit.gov/fhir) complicates the integration with entrenched legacy systems, often necessitating middleware solutions. These solutions serve as bridges between new and old systems but introduce additional layers that must be managed to maintain data accuracy and consistency.”

Additionally, there is a notable shortage of professionals skilled in FHIR and related standards, making it difficult to find qualified personnel to lead these integration efforts. As the demand for interoperable systems grows, the healthcare industry needs to enhance educational and professional development opportunities in health IT to address these challenges effectively.

## New US health data sharing initiative promises enhanced interoperability

The newly proposed [HTI-2 rule](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/07/10/hhs-proposes-hti-2-rule-improve-patient-engagement-information-sharing-public-health-interoperability.html), as discussed by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, is stirring optimism for further advancing interoperability within healthcare in the US. This initiative not only sets new standards and introduces robust API capabilities but also establishes **new certification criteria aimed at improving the way health information is shared** among patients, providers, payers, and public health entities. The rule focuses heavily on standards-based application programming interfaces (APIs) to enhance end-to-end interoperability between data exchange partners, including healthcare providers and public health organizations or payers. \
\
By addressing the ongoing challenges of data exchange, cybersecurity, and patient engagement in a more integrated and effective manner, HTI-2 aims to improve public health responses and advance the delivery of value-based care. This represents a significant milestone as the healthcare sector moves towards a more digitally cohesive environment, ensuring that systems not only coexist but also communicate seamlessly to support **a truly interconnected healthcare framework**. This development could dramatically simplify data handling, streamline patient care, and reduce administrative burdens across the board.

## Future of interoperability in healthcare

In conclusion, interoperability in health tech isn’t just a technical necessity; it’s the cool new trend that’s redefining healthcare. It’s about transforming healthcare from a VHS tape to a seamless streaming service. **Dr Brown** sums up the sentiment perfectly: "*Interoperability is crucial for efficient, cost-effective, and quality patient care"*​. \
\
With technology allowing systems to communicate more freely, the future of healthcare looks not just interconnected but intelligently integrated. **This is a journey that requires not only technological advancements but also a cultural shift towards open, shared health data ecosystems**.
