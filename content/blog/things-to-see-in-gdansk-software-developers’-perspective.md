**As a software development studio based in Gdańsk, our team not only creates software here but also spends free time exploring the city. Many of us are Gdańsk enthusiasts, so we’d like to share some of our favorite spots from a local perspective. These are some of the best places in Gdańsk to sightsee, relax, run, sail, and much more.**

## Brzeźno Beach

Brzeźno Beach is perfect for relaxation and recreation. Here, you can enjoy barbecues, play volleyball, or engage in beach yoga. It's also home to a pier, ideal for a leisurely stroll or watching the sunset.

## Old Town from Motlawa’s point of view
