The recent HLTH Europe conference served as a platform for leading voices in healthcare technology to share insights and debate the future of the industry. Here's a deeper look at the transformative trends highlighted by these experts, which are shaping the next generation of healthcare.



## 1. Digital transformation as a catalyst



The digital transformation of healthcare continues to accelerate, driven by the need for more integrated systems. Aahuti Rai emphasized that the challenge lies not in the capabilities of technology but in our readiness to adopt and integrate these advancements effectively into daily healthcare practices.

<blockquote><h2></h2><div> I'm not really buzzed about specific technologies. It's more about how you put them to use and make them relevant for people. The buzz for me is about what the technology enables…</div><footer>Aahuti Rai, Strategic Advisor, Venture Partner @ Four Points Consulting</footer></blockquote>



## 2. The imperative of interoperability

Interoperability remains a critical focus, with Dr. Adam Brown pointing out its role in enhancing patient care through error reduction and efficient data exchange. Seamless connectivity between different health systems is essential for the next steps in healthcare evolution.

<blockquote><h2></h2><div>Very simply, the ability for different systems to communicate has a profound impact on patients getting the right care.</div><footer>Dr Adam Brown, Founder @ ABIG Health</footer></blockquote>



## 3. Advancements in women’s health tech

Attention to women's health tech is growing, filling gaps in historically under-served areas. Claudia Pastides noted the increasing number of digital solutions aimed at improving women's health, a trend that promises better understanding and support for women’s health issues.

<blockquote><h2></h2><div>Apart from AI, which is still in its early stages, I think there's a growing focus on women's health. Women's health has been under-researched and neglected for a long time, but there's increasing recognition that it's a global issue.</div><footer>Dr Claudia Pastides, Medical Director @ Flo</footer></blockquote>



## 4. The rise of remote care

\
Remote care technologies are reshaping where and how care is delivered. Łukasz Krasnopolski from Higo Sense explained how new devices are enabling comprehensive health assessments from the home, expanding access to healthcare services, especially in remote and underserved areas.

<blockquote><h2></h2><div>One major trend is the increasing recognition of the lack of doctors. This has become a critical issue, and companies are seeking solutions. Telemedicine alone isn’t enough. The trend is moving towards home care and finding ways to provide medical services to patients wherever they are. This includes integrating various solutions to address the doctor shortage and improve access to care.</div><footer>Łukasz Krasnopolski, Founder & CEO @ Higo</footer></blockquote>



## 5. Innovations in pain management and diagnostic AI

\
Guy Simian from Sensars discussed their approach to chronic pain management through neurostimulation, tailored for individual needs. Concurrently, AI's role in diagnostics is expanding, with Bartosz Borucki from Smart Diagnostics highlighting its use in detecting early signs of orthopedic conditions, signaling a shift towards proactive healthcare.



<blockquote><h2></h2><div>We set out to treat chronic neuropathic pain, particularly in the foot, which affects over 2 million people each year worldwide that are intractable to medication and other solutions. We're doing this through neurostimulation, but not just any ordinary neurostimulation. We're transforming the way neurostimulation works. Instead of placing a lead next to a nerve, we safely inject microelectrodes inside a peripheral nerve.</div><footer>Guy Siman, Co-Founder & COO @ Sensars</footer></blockquote>



## 6. Prioritizing patient-centric experiences





The digital journey of patients is becoming a core focus, enhancing how they engage with healthcare systems. Fernando Campos Soares shared how his platform is making health data management more accessible and patient-friendly, emphasizing patient autonomy over their health records.



<blockquote><h2></h2><div>I believe healthcare needs to shift its priorities to focus more on patients. While it's important to improve doctors' administrative work, we must prioritize the patient's overall experience and outcomes. The trend should be about integrating solutions that enhance the entire patient journey, not just isolated digital parts.</div><footer>Fernando Campos Soares, Founder & CEO @ Nuria</footer></blockquote>



## 7. Ethical data management

\
\
Mohamed Al Ubadi stressed the ethical management of health data, ensuring patients retain ownership and control over their personal health information. This practice not only supports patient autonomy but also builds trust by making health data management transparent and consent-based.

<blockquote><h2></h2><div>The first thing we do is ensure that the data and records are owned by the person. They ultimately decide when to share them. For instance, when you visit the doctor, the doctor gets the data automatically for your convenience. But it's your record, your information, and technically your property. We explain to our customers, who are healthcare providers, that this really works for everyone, including those who don't speak the first language.</div><footer>Mohammad Al-Ubaydli, Founder & CEO @ PHIN</footer></blockquote>

7. Predictive analytics and personalized medicine

\
\
The use of big data and predictive analytics is forging paths towards personalized medicine, where treatments are precisely tailored to individual genetic and lifestyle factors. This approach is set to transform healthcare from reactive to anticipatory, focusing on prevention rather than just treatment.

<blockquote><h2></h2><div>I believe we will continue the trend of more generalization in AI. We will see more integration of different data sources and more comprehensive models that can draw general conclusions from diverse information. This will be particularly important in healthcare, where integrating historical patient data, environmental data, and other sources will be crucial for effective diagnostics and treatment.</div><footer>Bartosz Borucki </footer></blockquote>



## Conclusion

The HLTH conference highlighted a dynamic shift towards more sophisticated, patient-centric, and ethically managed healthcare systems. As industry experts keep innovating, the healthcare sector is on the brink of a major change, ready to provide unmatched personalized care and greater control to patients.
