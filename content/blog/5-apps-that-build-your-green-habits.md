## 1. Too Good To Go

We all have done it ‚Äì throw away food that is still edible. It is also a dreadful yet daily reality for the
representatives of the retail and restaurant industries. For example, the restaurants in the United States alone
generate even [33 billion pounds of food waste](https://foodprint.org/issues/the-problem-of-food-waste/) each
year. [The app ‚ÄúToo Good To Go‚Äù](https://toogoodtogo.com/en-us) helps to save the food with a close date of expiration
from shops and restaurants. Users can ‚Äúrescue meals‚Äù by purchasing them at a great price with the app. Thanks to apps
like ‚ÄúToo Good To Go‚Äù, food that was supposed to be trash gets a new home and a happy stomach. üòâ

## 2. Relevo

Do you know
that [plastic needs even 500 years to decompose](https://www.wwf.org.au/news/blogs/the-lifecycle-of-plastics#gs.b888tb)?
How often have you picked up lunch in a plastic bag that is gonna stay with the next 17 generations? And that is only
the tip of the plastic iceberg. German startup Relevo prepared an answer to the problem that plastic containers are evil
companions of our food to go. Thanks to [Relevo](https://relevo.de), users in the biggest German cities can go to
restaurants and pick up their orders in eco-friendly, reusable containers that you just have to return in the next 2
weeks. **We are proudly helping Relevo to grow by developing its web and mobile
applications.** [Go deeper into the Relevo story.](/projects/eco-friendly-app/)

## 3. HappyCow

[HappyCow](https://www.happycow.net) helps to find vegan places near you. Our food choices have an impact on our planet.
By reducing or cutting off meat completely from our diets we help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation and
freshwater contamination. HappyCow is a great app for everyone who likes to find a good vegan place.

## 4. Litterati

Having fun while picking up litter? That‚Äôs the goal for [Litterati](https://litterati.org). The app inspires individuals
to clean their surroundings and therefore motivates a community to make bigger changes. Users pick up the litter around
them, take pictures and tag it to show the community the power of seemingly little actions. Then the app creates maps of
the litter cleaned by people around the world to engage more people to act!

## 5. Geev

[Geev](https://www.geev.com/en) enables you to pass on unneeded food, furniture, home appliances and more. Instead of
sending them to the trash, users can donate them to others. Of course, there are many other apps offering similar
services, so take Geev only as an example. It just shows that giving your things another purpose isn‚Äôt something either
challenging or time-consuming because there are many apps that make it simpler.
