## Understanding Generative AI

Generative AI is designed to create new content or data that resembles authentic, human-generated material. These systems can produce a wide variety of outputs, including text, images, music, and even video, based on the patterns and structures they have learned from their training data.

### Example of Generative AI – Own Knowledge Base Chatbot

Do you have tons of content regarding your product or solution? You can transform them into a chatbot assisting your customers and alleviating some burden from the support team.

Or maybe you want to use the chatbot internally to support your marketing and sales in content generation based on the content you already have on your website. That’s the case of the chatbot our team has developed internally.

Our internal chatbots process information on our webpage, including hundreds of blog posts, providing the fastest access to content generated by dozens of people over a decade. the preview below shows the real use case of our chatbot (with PlugBear):
