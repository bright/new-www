Here come the slides from a talk I gave at the last [Cocoaheads Tricity](https://www.facebook.com/CocoaHeadsTricity) meeting. It's titled "Automate your iOS deployment a bit"
and shows how we approach build and deployment automation at Bright Inventions. In just a few days we're going to publish our "generate-ios" Yeoman generator on [Github](http://www.github.com/bright).

We welcome you to join us at next [Cocoaheads Tricity](https://www.facebook.com/CocoaHeadsTricity) meetings where we talk and learn about Cocoa, Swift, Objective-C, UX/UI design and everything else related to creating apps on this platform.
