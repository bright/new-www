Recently I have been reading [SQL Performance Explained by Markus Winand](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17225810-sql-performance-explained) and I wanted to share with you what I have learned regarding SQL pagination scalability. 

Probably if you would be given the task to implement pagination, you would do it with `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` in a query. This would be completely fine, but it is good to know the limitations of it. 

The more you browse back in history (increase `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`) the more **response time increases.** This is due to the fact that DB has to count all rows until it reaches the requested page. 

An answer for that would be to include a `WHERE` statement in a query with `FETCH FIRST X ROWS ONLY`, which does not select previous results. Each "page" is limited with a different `WHERE` statement.  It also has its own limitations (harder to implement pagination, harder to browser backward, fetch arbitrary pages) but at a cost of simplicity, you get a performance increase.

Which option we should choose? As always in computer science - it depends :)

Let me know how do you use pagination and if you ever had any performance issues related to that.

P.S Remember that pagination needs deterministic order and do include `ORDER BY` in your queries when needed ;)
