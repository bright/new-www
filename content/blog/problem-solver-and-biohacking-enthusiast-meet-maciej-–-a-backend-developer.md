## Have you always felt that backend development is the ultimate programming path for you?

Yes, I guess I never felt a strong connection with UI. I don't think I have that aesthetic sense in me. I was always **more interested in the logical and technical aspects of software development**.

## You are an observability and app performance monitoring enthusiast. Why do you recommend implementing telemetry in software projects?

Nowadays, no one can imagine an application without logs – there's no debate here. **Telemetry is simply the new standard, a step up**. The boundaries are changing, and more and more software engineers cannot imagine a real-life application without implemented telemetry data monitoring.
