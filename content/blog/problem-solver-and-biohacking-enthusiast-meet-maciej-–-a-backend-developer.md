**Maciej loves to closely monitor the state of the applications he develops as much as the health of his body. Discover why he can’t imagine software development without telemetry and test-driven development. Read the career story of Maciej, Senior Backend Developer at Bright Inventions.**

## Have you always felt that backend development is the ultimate programming path for you?

Yes, I guess I never felt a strong connection with UI. I don't think I have that aesthetic sense in me. I was always **more interested in the logical and technical aspects of software development**.

## You are an observability and app performance monitoring enthusiast. Why do you recommend implementing telemetry in software projects?

Nowadays, no one can imagine an application without logs – there's no debate here. **Telemetry is simply the new standard, a step up**. The boundaries are changing, and more and more software engineers cannot imagine a real-life application without implemented telemetry data monitoring.

**It's our job as software engineers to constantly monitor the real state of the app, to see if it works properly and, if not, what isn't working as it should.** Gathering data exclusively from logs is simply not enough these days. I could not feel comfortable being responsible for an application running on a production environment, without having at least a basic set of metrics telling me about application health.
