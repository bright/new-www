**Maciej loves to closely monitor the state of the applications he develops as much as the health of his body. Discover why he can’t imagine software development without telemetry and test-driven development. Read the career story of Maciej, Senior Backend Developer at Bright Inventions.**

## Have you always felt that backend development is the ultimate programming path for you?

Yes, I guess I never felt a strong connection with UI. I don't think I have that aesthetic sense in me. I was always **more interested in the logical and technical aspects of software development**.

## You are an observability and app performance monitoring enthusiast. Why do you recommend implementing telemetry in software projects?

Nowadays, no one can imagine an application without logs – there's no debate here. **Telemetry is simply the new standard, a step up**. The boundaries are changing, and more and more software engineers cannot imagine a real-life application without implemented telemetry data monitoring.

**It's our job as software engineers to constantly monitor the real state of the app, to see if it works properly and, if not, what isn't working as it should.** Gathering data exclusively from logs is simply not enough these days. I could not feel comfortable being responsible for an application running on a production environment, without having at least a basic set of metrics telling me about application health.

## At Bright Inventions, you are part of the team developing a telemedicine solution. What are the challenges you faced?

First of all, our client is still a startup, so requirements are dynamic, and deadlines are tight. One of the challenges is **delivering features effectively and quickly finding solutions to our client's problems**. To respond swiftly to the client’s needs, **I follow best practices like modularity, test-driven development, and domain-driven design**. These approaches may seem like catchy buzzwords, but they are helpful tools in my daily work.

Right now, one of the biggest challenges I face is **integrating with external medtech providers**. Our application integrates with, for example, an external clinic, and it’s our job to adjust our system to be able to receive and process data from external providers, even if their systems work completely differently. 

The key aspect is **multilevel testing**, which enables me to quickly verify if any changes needed for a successful integration have affected some of the app’s functions. **Without test-driven development, I couldn't be sure if adjusting to external parties wouldn’t introduce regression**.

## What used to be a challenge for you at work and now it’s not anymore?

When I joined Bright Inventions, I had to catch up on a lot of technological aspects, and there was a lot of learning to do. Now, the tech aspects are no longer a struggle for me. **The challenges I face now are more communication-oriented**. For example, **I am still learning how to present technical aspects** to clients' representatives in a simple and straightforward manner or to **explain and justify architectural decisions to my team members**.
