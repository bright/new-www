If you develop POS systems for the hospitality and retail industries, you're aware that your end users are busy. Whether they're waitstaff or shop assistants, they need to complete payment processes quickly. Every additional screen or unnecessary animation will slow them down, potentially leading to lost revenue for these businesses. Follow best POS UI design practices when designing payment features for hospitality and retail.

## Best practices for payment in POS design

Letâ€™s remember that our **end users are waitstaff, shop assistants, and hotel receptionists**. They work under significant stress and time pressure, managing as many clients as possible to drive revenue for the business. **Technology should accelerate their processes**, not only improving efficiency but also enhancing customer satisfaction.

## Use animations for information purposes only

Avoid purely decorative animations, as they can slow users down. Focus on including only informative animations that provide essential feedback, such as indicating when a payment is being processed.
