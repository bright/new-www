## Your passion for new technology started when you built your computer at 13. Tell us more about that experience.

I dreamt about having a better computer than the one I had at home. I wanted to build a computer from scratch, and **I managed to assemble most of the parts with some help from my parents**. I had to read tech documentation, and that‚Äôs how it all started. Years later, I still read the documentation. üôÇ

When I had this computer, I got deep into the gaming community. **I started creating simple webpages based on CMS platforms like WordPress**. Then I began **building game servers**. Those were times when game creators were more open to the community; you could add lots of mods and run your own servers. You could even earn some money from it.

Then, in technical school, I followed my passion for informatics and explored web development and basic frontend skills. I went to college to study Applied Computer Science, and that‚Äôs when programming truly began for me. **Studies forced me to learn some older languages like C++**, yet I quickly started to appreciate that. **Knowing these ‚Äúclunky‚Äù languages made it easier to switch to other technologies and enjoy their simplicity**. Obviously, my studies didn‚Äôt give me all the knowledge I needed, especially regarding working in a team with Git and CI/CD tools.

## How did your and Bright Inventions‚Äô paths cross?

It was 2 years ago when I was working at a software development agency, but my project ended and I was devastated because I enjoyed working with that team. **Eventually, Agata (a recruiter) reached out to me on LinkedIn**. It wasn‚Äôt anything new, but her message stood out because **she was very transparent about the company, projects, and clients I could work for**. That‚Äôs not always the case when you talk to recruiters. Also, at Bright Inventions, I had the chance to work with a tech stack I was keen on, including Node.js and NestJS.

**I actually wanted to join Bright Inventions after the initial screening with Agata. I was already super excited about this job opportunity.**
