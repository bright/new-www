**A few months ago, I bought a basic pen tablet on a whim. It was really cheap — less than $100 — and I wasn’t entirely sure how it would fit into my day-to-day work as a software engineer, but it has since become a handy tool in my workflow. In this post, I’ll share how using a graphic tablet has changed the way I explain concepts, review work, and even rediscover a long-forgotten joy in drawing.**

## Natural and Intuitive

Explaining complex software concepts often involves diagrams or sketches, whether it’s a system architecture or a specific flow of data. With a tablet, I can draw these ideas as if I’m standing at a whiteboard, but without being limited by physical space or needing access to a physical whiteboard.

The pen makes drawing feel more intuitive than using a mouse or touchpad, allowing me to express ideas quickly and naturally.

## Annotating With Ease

When reviewing code or documentation, I often find myself needing to add a few visual notes, like highlighting key parts or showing how different components relate. With a tablet, I can take screenshots and easily mark them up with arrows, lines, or words without switching between different tools.

The freedom to use the tablet like paper means I don’t have to toggle between different editing modes—it’s all there, waiting for me to draw what I need. It saves time and makes feedback more visual, which is often more effective than text alone.

## The Freedom of Pen and Paper, Digitally

The act of drawing with a pen tablet almost feels like using real pen and paper, which brings a level of comfort and simplicity to digital work. It’s almost like sketching in a notebook but on a screen (and you can _undo_ if you make a mistake 😅). After some practice, the need to look at the screen instead of the tablet becomes second nature.

What I love most is that this approach avoids the clunky back-and-forth that comes with traditional drawing tools, like needing to switch between pointer, line, and text modes. With the tablet, all the tools feel seamlessly integrated into the act of drawing itself.

## Rediscovering the Joy of Drawing

Perhaps the most unexpected benefit of using the tablet is the simple pleasure of drawing. Even though I’m no artist, the physical act of creating something by hand—whether it’s a messy diagram or a simple sketch—has been incredibly freeing and joyful. It’s a reminder that creativity isn’t always about the outcome, but the process.

## Conclusion

A pen tablet may seem like an unusual tool for a software engineer, but it has proven to be an essential part of my workflow. Whether I’m explaining a technical concept, reviewing a colleague’s work, or simply doodling for fun, the tablet has transformed how I communicate and work.
