If you have ever needed to add a chart to your Android app, you certainly have heard about [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart) by [PhilJay](https://github.com/PhilJay). If not, consider using this powerful library. Let me show you how easy it is to start!

![header img](/images/radek/chart_mobile.jpg)

## Goal

The goal is to build a simple app written in Kotlin which displays a linear chart with static data. To make it a little bit more interesting we're going to provide data with `.csv` file. It is very simple format for storing table-based data in the form of text files where values are separated with commas (Comma Separated Values). We'll use an [`OpenCSV`](http://opencsv.sourceforge.net/) library to parse it.

## Dependencies

First add dependencies to gradle files.

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
```

```groovy
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation "com.github.PhilJay:MPAndroidChart:v3.0.3"
    implementation "com.opencsv:opencsv:4.1"
```

## Raw Data Set

Find some data, for example from *[here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)*. I've chosen *[food searches on Google](https://www.kaggle.com/GoogleNewsLab/food-searches-on-google-since-2004)* set and cut it a little to display comparison of two searches: `banana bread` and `frozen yogurt`. The file looks like this:

```csv
id,googleTopic,week_id,value
banana-bread,/m/04cym9,2004-01,30
banana-bread,/m/04cym9,2004-02,31
banana-bread,/m/04cym9,2004-03,24
banana-bread,/m/04cym9,2004-04,27
...
```

There are `676` records in both datasets. Values are normalised, so `value` is between `0` and `100`, where `0` is the lowest number of searches, `100` is the largest, and the rest are calculated proportionally.

Put `banana_bread.csv` & `frozen_yogurt.csv` under `/app/res/raw` directory in your project.

Now let's make a `data class` with corresponding field, the simplest as it can be:

`FoodSearch.kt`  

```kotlin
package com.bi.chartapp

data class FoodSearch(
        val id: String,
        val googleTopic: String,
        val week_id: String,
        val value: Int
)
```

## How to parse it?

Take a look at the parser below:

`Parser.kt`

```kotlin
package com.bi.chartapp

import com.opencsv.CSVReaderBuilder
import java.io.Reader

class Parser {

    companion object {

        fun toDataSet(reader: Reader): List<FoodSearch> {

            val csvReader = CSVReaderBuilder(reader)
                    .withSkipLines(1)
                    .build()

            val foodSearches = mutableListOf<FoodSearch>()
            var record = csvReader.readNext()

            while (record != null) {
                foodSearches.add(FoodSearch(record[0], record[1], record[2], record[3].toInt()))
                record = csvReader.readNext()
            }

            return foodSearches
        }
    }
}
```

The static method builds a list of `FoodSearch` records based on the provided `Reader`. You can get a reader from `fileStream`, which is provided with activity resources. It looks like this:

```kotlin
val streamBananas = resources.openRawResource(R.raw.banana_bread)
val bananaData = Parser.toDataSet(streamBananas.reader())
```

Finally our data looks a little bit more friendly. Time to make a chart!

## Apply data

Add `LineChart` view to your layout, for example:

```xml
<com.github.mikephil.charting.charts.LineChart
        android:id="@+id/lineChart"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        android:layout_centerInParent="true" />
```

How to manage data now?

`LineChart` accepts data as an instance of `LineData` class. `LineData` is created from at least one instance of `LineDataSet`. `LineDataSet` is created from `MutableList` of `Entry` objects and `String` label. Huh. And `Entry` is an object representing single point on our Chart (basically is an (x,y) representation). It sounds a little bit overwhelming at first, but it is pretty simple. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Parse your data from a csv file to a list of any data objects representing a single point on the chart - DONE!
2. Map the list of data objects to the list of `Entry` objects
3. Create `LineDataSet` from the list of entries and label, like "Banana Bread"
4. Use each of the sets as an argument to create `LineData` object. Voila.

```kotlin
private fun getEntriesFromCSV(rawResId: Int, label: String): LineDataSet {

    var data: List<FoodSearch>? = null
    resources.openRawResource(rawResId).use { stream ->
        data = Parser.toDataSet(stream.reader())
    }
    val entries: MutableList<Entry> = ArrayList()

    data?.mapIndexed { index, foodSearch ->
        entries.add(
                Entry(index.toFloat(), foodSearch.value.toFloat(), foodSearch)
        )
    }

    return LineDataSet(entries, label)
}
```

This function and Parser from the previous paragraph creates `LineDataSet` from `csv` resource. Now simply call it for each `csv` file and create `LineData`:

```kotlin
val bananaDataSet = getEntriesFromCSV(R.raw.banana_bread, "Banana Bread")
val yogurtDataSet = getEntriesFromCSV(R.raw.frozen_yogurt, "Frozen Yogurt")

lineChart.data = LineData(
        bananaDataSet,
        yogurtDataSet
)
```

That's it, the chart is set up with data!

## Make me beautiful - LineChart properties

Time to add some colors and spices. The chart layout configuration is very flexible. I'll show you some basic properties, the rest you may find in the [documentation](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki). Props are separated between dataset-specific and chart-specific.

### Tune up data sets

First add some colors to the resource `colors.xml` file in order to make banana look a little bit more like <span style={{color: "#ffe100"}}>banana</span> and yogurt like <span style={{color: "#0085c7"}}>yogurt</span>.

```xml
<color name="banana">#ffe100</color>
<color name="yogurt">#0085c7</color>
```

We'll configure each of the `LineDataSet` object the same way, but with a different color. Check out the method below with the comments:

```kotlin
private fun configureSetLayout(set: LineDataSet, color: Int) {

    set.color = color                         // color of the line
    set.setDrawFilled(true)                   // fill the space between line and chart bottom
    set.fillColor = color                     // color of the fill
    set.setDrawCircles(false)                 // disable drawing circles over each Entry point
    set.mode = LineDataSet.Mode.CUBIC_BEZIER  // round the line
    set.fillAlpha = 50                        // make fill transparent with alpha (0-255)

}
```

Now apply configuration to each dataset:

```kotlin
val bananaColor = resources.getColor(R.color.banana, null)
val yogurtColor = resources.getColor(R.color.yogurt, null)

configureSetLayout(bananaDataSet, bananaColor)
configureSetLayout(yogurtDataSet, yogurtColor)
```

### Tune up a chart

You may configure the chart behaviour in many ways. Default setting allows the user to scale the chart with pinching and scroll it. Since our dataset contains ~700 records let's leave the ability to scale the chart along the axis X and only block the ability to scale it along axis Y. Also remove a description from the right bottom corner and highlighting values by tapping. Like that:

```kotlin
lineChart.description.isEnabled = false

lineChart.isHighlightPerTapEnabled = false
lineChart.isHighlightPerDragEnabled = false
lineChart.isScaleYEnabled = false
```

It works more intuitively already. Now notice that the description above the top X axis are float values. They don't say much unfortunately. It would be better if they marked a year's change every 52 weeks! To achieve this use `IAxisValueFormatter`. It looks like this:

```kotlin
inner class MyAxisFormatter : IAxisValueFormatter {
    override fun getFormattedValue(value: Float, axis: AxisBase?): String {
        return if (value.toInt() % 52 == 0) "${startingYear + value.toInt() / 52}"
        else ""
    }
}
```

It means that it will display a value only if it is divisible by 52. And then maps the value to a corresponding year (with starting year set to 2004). We need also a proper granularity so there won't be any grid between years.

```kotlin
lineChart.xAxis.valueFormatter = MyAxisFormatter()
lineChart.xAxis.granularity = 52f
```

 Also who needs an Y axis on both sides? Disable one of them:

```kotlin
lineChart.axisRight.isEnabled = false
```

 Boom! That's it! Looks nice and presents the data clearly. Pinch to zoom, swipe right and left to get through all these years and finally check when a frozen yogurt beats a banana bread in Google searches!\

Oh, it looks like every year around summer! Who would know.
