**The Internet of Things will be one of the key technologies supporting the digital transformation of healthcare. Dive into IoT for healthcare, explore IoMT devices, and meet companies already taking crucial steps in implementing IoT in the daily care of patients.**

## Internet of Things in healthcare: the definition and example

The Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare refers to the network of medical devices and applications that communicate and exchange data due to an Internet and bluetooth connection.

For example, smart healthcare devices such as thermometers, spirometers and pulse oximeters might create a healthcare IoT network that measures patients' vital signs and processes them in a special app. Now, the app could send data to a designated doctor who can immediately verify the state of a patient.

## IoT in the healthcare market overview

According to [IoT in Healthcare Market](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/iot-healthcare-market-160082804.html), the global IoT in Healthcare market size is projected to grow from $127.7 billion in 2023 to $289.2 billion by 2028.

## Top challenges in developing IoT solutions in healthcare

### Data security and privacy

Before you craft your IoT network, you need to implement security protocols and ensure secure data storage & sharing. Using a cloud provider for data storage can speed up your process of adhering to HIPAA or GDPR.

### Integration of devicesâ€™ SDKs

Some software teams face the challenge of integrating various healthcare devices with distinct Software Development Kits (SDKs) into a cohesive system. As a system owner, you need to be aware that designing a unified system might take more time than you initially assumed.

### Poor internet coverage

Medical systems should not be solely dependent on an internet connection, particularly when developing IoT solutions for remote patient monitoring. Interruptions in the storage and sharing of data can have serious implications for patient health. 

A viable solution is an offline mode, allowing data to be stored locally and synchronized automatically once the connection is reestablished. Read our [guide to offline-first applications](/blog/offline-first-app-guide-for-startups-app-owners-case-studies/).
