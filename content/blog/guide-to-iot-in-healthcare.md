**The Internet of Things will be one of the key technologies supporting the digital transformation of healthcare. Dive into IoT for healthcare, explore IoMT devices, and meet companies already taking crucial steps in implementing IoT in the daily care of patients.**

## Internet of Things in healthcare: the definition and example

The Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare refers to the network of medical devices and applications that communicate and exchange data due to an Internet and bluetooth connection.

<div className="image">![IoT in healthcare devices](/images/iot_in_healthcare.png "IoT in healthcare devices")</div>

For example, smart healthcare devices such as thermometers, spirometers and pulse oximeters might create a healthcare IoT network that measures patients' vital signs and processes them in a special app. Now, the app could send data to a designated doctor who can immediately verify the state of a patient.

## IoT in the healthcare market overview

According to [IoT in Healthcare Market](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/iot-healthcare-market-160082804.html), the global IoT in Healthcare market size is projected to grow from $127.7 billion in 2023 to $289.2 billion by 2028.

## Top challenges in developing IoT solutions in healthcare

### Data security and privacy

Before you craft your IoT network, you need to implement security protocols and ensure secure data storage & sharing. Using a cloud provider for data storage can speed up your process of adhering to HIPAA or GDPR.

### Integration of devices’ SDKs

Some software teams face the challenge of integrating various healthcare devices with distinct Software Development Kits (SDKs) into a cohesive system. As a system owner, you need to be aware that designing a unified system might take more time than you initially assumed.

### Poor internet coverage

Medical systems should not be solely dependent on an internet connection, particularly when developing IoT solutions for remote patient monitoring. Interruptions in the storage and sharing of data can have serious implications for patient health. 

A viable solution is an offline mode, allowing data to be stored locally and synchronized automatically once the connection is reestablished. Read our [guide to offline-first applications](/blog/offline-first-app-guide-for-startups-app-owners-case-studies/).

## Use cases & examples of IoT in healthcare

### Telemedicine & Remote Patient Monitoring

IoT enables continuous patient monitoring through wearable devices and other health sensors. This can significantly improve patient care by providing real-time data on vital signs like heart rate, blood pressure, and glucose levels. Remote monitoring is particularly valuable for managing chronic conditions and for elderly care, reducing the need for frequent hospital visits.

**Companies that do already do it: Oracle Health, Meditech**

### Electronic Health Records

IoT enhances EHR systems by providing richer, real-time data that improves the quality of care, operational efficiency, and patient outcomes in healthcare settings. EHR systems can use data collected from IoT devices to perform predictive analytics, identifying potential health issues before they become serious.

Companies that do already do it: MedKitDoc, Camascope, 

### Wearable Health Monitors

Devices like fitness bands and other wearable health trackers allow continuous monitoring of patients' vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels. These devices can alert patients and doctors to potential health issues before they require acute care.

Companies that do already do it: Fitbit, Garmin

### Smart Hospitals

IoT devices are used in hospitals to enhance patient care and optimize operations. For example, smart beds can detect when they're occupied and when a patient is attempting to get up. IoT can also track the location of medical equipment, like wheelchairs or defibrillators, improving asset utilization and reducing costs.

**Companies that do already do it: GE Healthcare, Siemens Healthineers**

### Personalized Medicine

IoT can analyze data from various sources to tailor medical treatment to individual patients. This can involve adjusting medication based on how a patient's body reacts, which can be monitored through smart devices.

**Companies that do already do it: IBM Watson Health, 23andMe**

### Ingestible Sensors

These tiny electronic devices are swallowed by patients and can collect data from within the body to diagnose and monitor digestive tract issues, medication adherence, and more.

**Companies that do already do it: Proteus Digital Health, CapsoVision**

### Fall Detection

For elderly patients, sensors can detect changes in posture or abrupt movements that indicate a fall, automatically alerting healthcare providers and family members.

**Companies that do already do it: Apple, Philips Lifeline**

### Connected Inhalers

For patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), connected inhalers can track usage, monitor the patient's condition, and determine if the patient is using their inhaler correctly.

**Companies that do already do it: Propeller Health, Teva Pharmaceuticals**

### Smart Home Care

Smart home technologies can help patients with disabilities or the elderly live independently. This includes voice-activated devices, motion sensors, and other monitoring technologies that help ensure safety and provide alerts to caregivers when needed.

**Companies that do already do it: Google Nest, Alexa**

### Supply Chain Management

In healthcare facilities, IoT can be used for tracking inventory levels of medical supplies and automatically reordering when stock is low. This helps in ensuring that essential items are always available and can also help in tracking the usage rates of various supplies for better management.

**Companies that do already do it: SAP, Oracle**

### Telehealth and Virtual Visits

Although not exclusively an IoT application, telehealth often integrates IoT devices for better patient outcomes during virtual visits. Data collected through patient monitors can be transmitted during a telehealth session, giving healthcare providers a better understanding of the patient’s current health status.

**Companies that do already do it: Teladoc Health, Amwell**

## IoT devices - examples

IoT network in healthcare is also called The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). It refers to a connected infrastructure of medical devices, software applications, and health systems and services. Let’s assess IoMT potential in geriatric healthcare.

Devices and sensors such as cardiac monitors, fall-detection sensors, smart socks, digital mirrors, smart shoes, and assistive robots enable 24-hour care and remote patient monitoring. A physician or caregiver can monitor all the health data in real-time and respond with tailored treatment.
