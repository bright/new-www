Clutch is the world’s preeminent ratings and reviews platform for providers of B2B services. To be recognized by [research by Clutch](https://clutch.co/app-developers/poland) is one of the best things a company like us can hear, because Clutch rankings are determined by client reviews! Clutch conducts reviews from independently verified clients from around the world, so that you can feel comfortable in your next purchase of B2B services. We would even dare to say that Clutch is the gold standard for B2B ratings and reviews. 

That is why we’re honored to show off our stellar 4.9-star rating average on Clutch and its sister site The Manifest, [a business ranking platform](https://themanifest.com/app-development/companies/eastern-europe#bright-inventions)! We’ve received glowing reviews from clients from around the world, including a perfect 5.0-star review from Adam Pachucki, the head of product at Finebite!

In his review, he praised the full-cycle development services we built for his restaurant solutions platform. We built both an iOS and Android version of the app, and have provided ongoing maintenance and updates.

"We were pleased with their proactive approach and their genuine desire to see the success of the platform. They were constantly looking for ways to improve, and ensured that we had proper tracking tools and no potential scalability issues.” – Adam Pachucki

We’re incredibly grateful to Clutch and all our satisfied clients! And we want to say thank you to everyone who has helped us get this far.
