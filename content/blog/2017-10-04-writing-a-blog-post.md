Our blog is using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/bright/new-www).

## Verify you have access to github repository

1. Open [https://github.com/bright/new-www](https://github.com/bright/new-www/tree/gh-pages/_posts).
2. Click `Create new file` button. If the button is not there please ask [Ula 🚴‍](https://bright-inventions.slack.com/messages/D3B8FTX71), [Michał](https://bright-inventions.slack.com/messages/D04QP07B4) or [Daniel](https://bright-inventions.slack.com/messages/D04QP10LU) for access.
3. If you have access to the repository pick your way:

* [I can browse the web](#web)
* [I know `git`](#git)
* [I know `git`, `bundler` and other stuff](#git-bundler)

## <a name="web"></a>I can browse web

1. Open [https://github.com/bright/new-www](https://github.com/bright/new-www/tree/gh-pages/_posts)
2. Click `Create new file` and pick a name in format `yyyy-mm-dd-blog-post-title.md` where:

   * `yyyy`, `mm`, `dd` are published year, month and day of month respectively e.g. 2017-10-04
   * `blog-post-title` is the blog post title e.g. writing-a-blog-post
3. Paste the following content into the edit form:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: A human readable title of post
author: piotr
hidden: true
tags: [blog]
---

My blog post content.
```

The `title:` is self-explanatory nevertheless take special care to name your content nicely. 

The `author:` section has to have a value defined in [authors.yml](https://github.com/bright/new-www/blob/gh-pages/_data/authors.yml) file. If you are not there **edit the file and send a pull request** or ask [someone](https://bright-inventions.slack.com/messages/C3ELVL58F) to create entry for you. 

The `tags:` can and should have multiple keywords e.g. `tags: blog programming bright` describing blog post content. Tags can be specified as a YAML list or a space-separated string.

The `hidden: true` flag removes the post from [the blog page](http://brightinventions.pl/blog/). A page marked with `hidden: true` is still going to be available when you enter its full url into browser address bar (e.g http://brightinventions.pl/blog/do-more-with-what-you-have/). This is useful when you'd like to ask [someone](https://bright-inventions.slack.com/messages/C3ELVL58F) for review. 

When you have replaced `My blog post content.` with your thoughts, findings, article or rambling hit `Preview` button to get a rough idea on how your post is formatted.

If you don't find any obvious mistakes you can `Commit new file` which will save the content so that [someone](https://bright-inventions.slack.com/messages/C3ELVL58F) can review it. The post is going to be available under http://brightinventions.pl/blog/`blog-post-title` url after a minute or so. 

If you would like to correct some errors or remove `hidden: true` you can find the file and hit the <button><svg aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-pencil" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 14 16" width="14"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M0 12v3h3l8-8-3-3-8 8zm3 2H1v-2h1v1h1v1zm10.3-9.3L12 6 9 3l1.3-1.3a.996.996 0 0 1 1.41 0l1.59 1.59c.39.39.39 1.02 0 1.41z"></path></svg></button> button e.g. [https://github.com/bright/new-www/blob/gh-pages/_posts/2017-09-13-do-more-with-what-you-have.md](https://github.com/bright/new-www/blob/gh-pages/_posts/2017-09-13-do-more-with-what-you-have.md)

After edits are made hitting the `Commit changes` button will save the changes and publish them soon after. 

## <a name="git"></a>I know `git`

1. [Clone the repository](https://github.com/bright/new-www). 
2. When you have a rough idea what you'd like the post to be about use create a new file under `_drafts` folder named `yyyy-mm-dd-blog-post-title.md` where:

   * `yyyy`, `mm`, `dd` are published year, month and day of month respectively e.g. 2017-10-04
   * `blog-post-title` is the blog post title e.g. writing-a-blog-post
   * the file starts with the following content:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: A human readable title of post
author: piotr
hidden: true
tags: [blog]
---
```

Note that the `author:` section has to have a value defined in [authors.yml](https://github.com/bright/new-www/blob/gh-pages/_data/authors.yml) file. If you are not there **edit the file and send a pull request**. 
The `tags:` can have multiple values e.g. `tags: blog programming bright`

3. You can commit and push `_draft` whenever you need. The content is **not going** to be visible on the site.
4. Once you are ready to share your content with the world you need to move your blog post file from `_drafts` folder into `_posts` folder. Consider using pull request or hiding the post from listing with `hidden: true` included in [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/)
5. If you and your fellow 💍 colleagues are happy with how your brand new, shiny 💎 post looks like then merge the pull request or remove `hidden: true`
