## Was your career focused on mobile development from the start?

I started my career as a web developer, but at my first job, I unexpectedly joined a team that was working on a hybrid mobile application. My first tasks were related to mobile development, and **I quickly realized that I could build mobile apps using the web technologies** I was already familiar with. This experience really empowered me and got me hooked on mobile development, even though it had never crossed my mind before that I could build mobile apps.

## You specialize in React Native but also continue learning native technologies. Why is that?

In my first job, I worked exclusively with React Native. However, after two years, I changed jobs and began working on a much more advanced mobile app. This app required native modules to handle hardware communication and geolocation. 

This necessity "forced" me to learn Kotlin, which opened up more opportunities to optimize our hybrid app. **Whenever we found that certain features couldn't be optimized with React Native alone, we turned to native technologies**, building those parts in Kotlin to achieve better results. I've also been learning Swift, though I haven't yet had the opportunity to work with it professionally.

I've encountered numerous hybrid applications that reached their efficiency limits, and turning to native tech was the only way to optimize certain features. So, **knowing both hybrid and native stacks is crucial, even if you specialize in cross-platform development**.
