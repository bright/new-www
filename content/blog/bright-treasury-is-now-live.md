**We are excited to announce that BrightTreasury is now live!**

Bright Treasury is a web application that helps you to apply for Polkadot and Kusama Treasury funds in an easy and intuitive way. We want to attract more professionals who could contribute to the community with their ideas and skills but at the same time may not be as fluent in blockchain customs and terminology.

Now you can use Milestone 1 and Milestone 2 features at: treasury.bright.dev. This means that all the operations concerning Ideas and Proposals are ready to use! 

## What is BrightTreasury

We already wrote a blogpost about the app when our Milestone 1 was accepted so please [take a look](https://brightinventions.pl/blog/bright-treasury-a-treasury-module-application-funded-by-a-w3f-foundation-grant/) if you'd like to know more.

Bright Treasury is a standalone web application along with a PWA representation that allows performing basic actions on the Treasury module of [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/) and [Kusama](https://kusama.network/) Substrate networks. It allows a more intuitive and lightweight flow of submitting proposals as well as an overview of the Treasury related actions. Until now, the Treasury module has been only available as a part of the general network management tool. We believe that by introducing a dedicated app with a user-friendly interface, we will be able to attract more creative blockchain enthusiasts to apply for Treasury funds for their projects. 

## How to use BrightTreasury

Would you like to know more about how and when you might want to use Bright Treasury? 

### 1. If you have an idea...

The first step is to have an idea for an activity that might contribute to the Polkadot or Kusama networks community. Maybe one that would benefit both? If you have something in mind, then go on, show others what you came up with. Go to [treasury.bright.dev](https://treasury.bright.dev) and create an account. You can sign up using your email address or your Web3 blockchain account (with [polkadot extension](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/)) if you already have one. If you don’t, no worries, you can always add it later to your email based account in the settings page. 

Second step is to present your idea to the network’s community. Just click the “+Introduce Idea” button and try to give as many details about your idea as possible. It might be good to divide your planned activities into milestones, so it’s clear what is the schedule that you foresee. Need more time to work on the description? Save your idea as a draft and publish it whenever you feel ready.

Once it’s published, it will be visible to the network’s community and discussion can begin. You will be notified whenever a new comment appears, so you can answer any questions that the community members might have about your idea. 

Third step is when things get serious. You got the feedback, applied some changes and you are ready to turn your idea into a formal Treasury proposal. Maybe you want to start small, with just one milestone and then go with the next one? You can do that as well using the application. Just choose your idea or idea’s milestone and click “Turn into proposal”. To perform this operation you will need a blockchain account to sign the transaction and place the required deposit. 

Then it’s time for step four. It’s the one where you keep your fingers crossed and check on your proposal’s status. You might need to answer some more questions in the Discussions tab, so make sure you check your in-app notifications or that you switched on the email notifications as well. You will also be informed whenever a new motion concerning your proposal is opened. Everyone will be able to follow the results of the motions in the details of your proposal. 

Step five is when you celebrate (or learn that you’ll have to work on your proposal a bit more). When the motions reach a conclusion, your proposal is either accepted or rejected.

### 2. If you want to browse and discuss other people’s ideas

You’d like to take a look first, to see what others are up to? You can browse the active ideas for each network as well as current proposals without the need to log in.

However, if you’d like to engage in a discussion or work on your own idea, you’ll need to create an account. It’s a very quick process, especially if you already have a Web3 blockchain account, which you can use to sign up. When you are logged in, you get access to discussions and possibility to present your ideas for proposals.

## What to expect from the next release?

We are currently finishing Milestone 3 which is focused on Bounties mechanism. Users will be able to add and browse through bounties, voting results, their curators and check the current status. The curators will be able to accept (or reject) their nominations and manage the bounty’s status. It will be possible to see the description of a bounty published on Polkassembly as well. We will also include the history feature based on the data from Polkassembly, which would allow users to browse through closed proposals and bounties, in addition to in-app ideas. 

We can’t wait to show you the ready product soon. We hope you will enjoy using BrightTreasury and that it will become an important part of Polkadot and Kusama communities. 

We would greatly appreciate your feedback. Let us know what you think! And if you encounter any issues, please do not hesitate to inform us via [github](https://github.com/bright/bright-tresury/issues).
