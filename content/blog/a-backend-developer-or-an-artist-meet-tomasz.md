## How did your adventure with programming begin?

It began in gimnazjum (Polish middle school) during Computer Science classes. Though I feel the classes could have been conducted better, they planted the seed for my technical studies. Later, **in high school, I ensured that this was the path I wanted to follow**. 

I enjoyed writing little programs in Turbo Pascal; **I loved the feeling of bringing something to life with my code**, even if it was just a simple calculator. I felt like an artist. I still do actually. Then, I pursued Automatic Control and Robotics studies at the Gdansk University of Technology, where I first encountered Java.

## And you became a software developer?

Not quite. ðŸ˜‰ Although I completed a year-long internship as a Java developer, **I eventually shifted toward system networking**. This was related to my Master's studies at the Department of Computer Communications, so I decided to pursue this direction. **I started working at a large corporation, managing extensive networks and servers** that, for example, facilitated real-time trading. I worked there for almost four years and learned a great deal about network administration, but I also gained valuable insights into soft skills.
