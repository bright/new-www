## How did your adventure with programming begin?

It began in gimnazjum (Polish middle school) during Computer Science classes. Though I feel the classes could have been conducted better, they planted the seed for my technical studies. Later, **in high school, I ensured that this was the path I wanted to follow**. 

I enjoyed writing little programs in Turbo Pascal; **I loved the feeling of bringing something to life with my code**, even if it was just a simple calculator. I felt like an artist. I still do actually. Then, I pursued Automatic Control and Robotics studies at the Gdansk University of Technology, where I first encountered Java.

## And you became a software developer?

Not quite. ðŸ˜‰ Although I completed a year-long internship as a Java developer, **I eventually shifted toward system networking**. This was related to my Master's studies at the Department of Computer Communications, so I decided to pursue this direction. **I started working at a large corporation, managing extensive networks and servers** that, for example, facilitated real-time trading. I worked there for almost four years and learned a great deal about network administration, but I also gained valuable insights into soft skills.

**While technical skills are fundamental to the job, I learned how crucial soft skills are as well**. Improving my communication with colleagues, managers, and importantly, clients became a significant part of my learning. I still use that knowledge daily.

## However, at some point, you made the transition to software engineering.

After about two years, the job started to feel too repetitive for me. **I began looking for ways to optimize the work by writing scripts and applications that made the processes more efficient**. In doing so, I gradually found myself returning to programming, reigniting the passion I had for it previously. I started working on some side projects after work and also helped my younger friends who were still students. 

In programming, there is always something new; every day brings a new challenge, and that drove me. So, eventually, **I decided to leave my stable job and senior position, accepting a role as a junior software developer with a salary cut in half**. Starting from scratch was a challenge, but I'm deeply grateful for the wealth of network administration experience I gained over the years. **I believe it's a great asset to understand computing and to possess strong soft skills**. Finally, a year later, I landed a job at Bright Inventions as a backend developer.

## Could you share your recollections of the recruitment process at Bright Inventions?

The recruitment process was friendly, open, and smooth. **I enjoyed a talk with [Ula](/about-us/ula/) as well as a longer technical discussion with [Piotr](/about-us/piotr/)**. In the meantime, I had to complete a technical task. Even though there were some specific requirements and preferred technologies, I still felt **I had the freedom to solve the issue in the way I thought was best**. Eventually, I joined Bright Inventions, and my adventure with the company has now continued for over three years.
