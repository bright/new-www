Bright Inventions is excited to announce that we’ve been listed as a leading developer among Poland’s top B2B companies by Clutch! 

It is an honour to receive this award because we were selected largely based on how our clients rate our services! Clutch is the leading platform of B2B ratings and reviews. Based in Washington DC, Clutch’s team of analysts conduct in-depth client interviews in order to collect detailed information on vendors. Using the verified information, they’re able to provide a list of top performing agencies. 

We’re thankful for our clients who have supplied valuable information for our Clutch profile. We’ve enjoyed working closely with our partners and look forward to continuing our business relationships. We try to work on-site as much as possible and are dedicated to transparency in order to grow our partnerships and strengthen our collaborations. More than anything, we love helping our customers and seeing our projects grow into big, successful ventures.
