**Do women need to be treated differently? This question is gaining attention. Despite years of striving for equal treatment, there's now a push to tailor approaches to women's specific needs. This isn't about preferential treatment, but empowering women to take charge of their own health.**\
\
**Studies show that women often downplay their symptoms and delay seeking medical care due to [cultural and psychological factors.](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.94.12.2050) They prioritize their family's health over their own and face competing responsibilities like childcare and work. Many [normalize symptoms](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-06885-005) related to menstruation, menopause, or mental health as a normal part of life rather than potential health issues. Additionally, [stigma, embarrassment, and the belief that they should manage these issues independently](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/organization/dar/stigma-and-discrimination-research-toolkit) further discourage them from seeking care.**

Furthermore, [research shows significant differences in how male and female bodies respond to exercise, medical treatments, and supplements.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/366890228_Advancing_feminist_innovation_in_sport_studies_A_transdisciplinary_dialogue_on_gender_health_and_wellbeing) Historically taboo topics like menopause, menstruation, and the postpartum period are crucial aspects of women's lives, yet they have been overlooked for too long.



Thankfully, many initiatives are now **focusing on women's health.** This year’s [HLTH Europe Conference in Amsterdam](https://europe.hlth.com/) gave a special place for womens health related topics, localising the stage dedicated to female health related topics in the center of the conference area and naming it “Heart” stage. There were presented innovations like Discovering Hands, which empowers blind women while aiding in breast cancer detection, and Flo Health, which helps women understand their bodies better, are making significant impacts. The organizers of the conference didn’t miss tough topics like rape and sexual harrasement prevention.
