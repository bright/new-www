**Ula is the first non-developer who joined the Bright team over 5 years ago. Now, she is more than a crucial employee. She is our Bright mom (seriously). 😉 She takes care of the recruitment area, employees' well-being and our brand development. No matter what, you can always talk to Ula. And she will find time for you, despite the fact that she is one of the busiest people in the company. ;) Meet Ula – HR and Marketing Manager at Bright Inventions.**

## You studied English Philology to eventually got into Marketing and HR. What did this journey look like?

It was a really cool journey. I liked my studies a lot. In fact, I liked all of them. I started with translation studies at English Philology here in Gdańsk. I loved English and I had a few really great English teachers in the past who instilled love for this language in me. But when I was choosing my studies I was also thinking about psychology and marketing. The fun fact is that my maths teacher in the secondary school was encouraging me to take up some engineering studies then. And I liked maths a lot. Generally it was not an easy choice. 🙂

Anyway, during studies and after them I was translating texts from many different industries and **I loved this diversity, but at the same time I was into marketing a lot**. 

After my first MA I started an internship at a PR agency and at the same time I also decided to begin my second MA studies – marketing ones. I really like the feeling that I know the ins and outs of the field I work in. I remember I did many great practical projects during my studies. There were interesting subjects like creating brand strategies, company’s missions, preparing business plans, merchandising models etc. Dozens of creative things. I just love the process of creation. After I graduated I started my job at Twitter. At that time I also discovered that what I really needed was one brand and people around it.

## How do you recall working closely with such a big organization as Twitter?

I recall that as a great experience and a good lesson. I think it was a very important part of my professional development. I learned that there are different ways of managing people, micro-management ones and those based on freedom and responsibility that let you grow.

**I was working with dozens of brands from different industries** like Wirtualna Polska, Wedel, ING, Lays, **but also companies like DocPlanner or Booksy which were small startups back then**.  It was a great experience to discover different marketing strategies and work with different business needs. **And for sure the adventure was also visiting California and meeting the team working there including Adam Bein or Jack Dorsey**.

And disadvantages? I think that the feeling that you sometimes may put your whole heart into work, but you do not have an influence on the final decision of your clients or the organisation itself. 

## Eventually, you joined Bright Inventions where you manage our HR and Marketing activities. What gives you the most satisfaction at your job?

Yes, I started my employer branding and recruitment adventure at Bright Inventions in 2016 (Read this b[log post to know more about Ula’s beginnings at Bright](/blog/bright-inventions-turns-10-in-march-what-do-we-value/)). The surprising fact may be that **employer branding was not so easily recognisable at that time**. But I knew that for me it was a great opportunity to connect my love for people, psychology and marketing.

Bright Inventions was a beautiful blank page where I could put my all ideas into actions and use my creativity.There was almost nothing considering HR and marketing procedures when I joined. But there were great people. When I joined there **were eight people on board. And I really appreciate the trust and independence I was given**.

What gives me satisfaction is the feeling that I create something of great value. I **believe in what we create here**. I enjoy developing marketing and HR strategies, improving communication, and building the whole recruitment process. Actually, **I am all about optimisation**. The market is changing, people's needs and expectations are changing. We should adjust all the time. It is a dynamic and constant development.

And I really enjoy the recruitment area. I feel that thanks to my support new people can develop in the organisation or just can find the organisation they have been looking for. **I have a chance to build something more than a workplace, for me it is a community in which you can see the growth of people, their experience and expertise. I love my team here at Bright Inventions. I feel responsible for them**.

## And how do you adjust to these ongoing changes in the market?

I love learning and I think I am not afraid of experimenting and checking new ideas. **I like the agile way of thinking**. You are working on a solution, implementing it and then checking if it works. If the requirements and expectations change, you are introducing alterations and the whole process continues all the way round. 

I get inspiration from experts who have built really great companies, really great brands and above all great, strong teams. Often you do not have to reinvent the wheel, but what you can do is to link all the dots in your life in an interesting, sometimes unexpected way, and it works. It depends on us how we link these dots. But we can create some incredible stuff if we do not limit ourselves and do not follow common popular paths. 

## What is the most challenging thing about IT recruitment?

Finding a good cultural fit. I think that is the real challenge. There are a lot of talented software developers in the market, but **technical skills are not everything**. To make the relationship work for both sides, **we have to have a similar mindset and see a common goal**. Then both the new hire and the current team are happy. 

![Team Retreats](/images/brightstory_team.png)

Of course, functional programming knowledge, commercial experience and someone’s expertise are must-haves in particular roles, but at the same time we pay a huge attention to core values and non-technical skills each candidate posseses. We sometimes must reject applicants who have strong technical skills, but there is no cultural fit. We are pretty sure that these people would not cooperate well in our community and they would just not be happy. And **the point should always be to create a long lasting satisfactory relationship for both parties engaged in the process, the employer and the employee**. 

## So, what is the recipe for successful onboarding when you have this new hire already on board?

Communication is the key and is also the key in the onboarding process. When there is a new person in our team, we take care of him/her. And by taking care I mean proper planning, engaging buddies, organising follow-ups and check-ins or giving feedback. **New hires should not stress about what to do next after joining the team and they also should not stress about how they are doing**. A new employee should be provided with all the information, feedback and support they need. The less anxiety and worry in the beginning the better employee's experience we will have in the long-term. **Poor onboarding causes a lot of negative consequences, it does not only lower engagement and productivity, but also leads to high employee’s turnover**. The real and the worst cost of unplanned and defective onboarding is the loss of an employee in the end.
