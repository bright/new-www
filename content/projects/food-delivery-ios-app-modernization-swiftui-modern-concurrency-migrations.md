<TitleWithIcon sectionTitle="problem: finding a cohesive iOS development team" titleIcon="/images/icon_title_about.svg" titleIconAlt="problem" />

Our client, **a leading global online food delivery marketplace**, sought our expertise in iOS development to enhance their already popular food delivery app and benefit solution in Israel. **They required a highly skilled mobile development team with strong cohesion and experience working together for years**.

Our iOS experts quickly took charge of the existing app and **swiftly familiarized themselves with the app's structure and underlying code**. That smooth transition allowed us to efficiently maintain the current solution while simultaneously planning and executing further modernizations and development.
