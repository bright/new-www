<TitleWithIcon sectionTitle="problem: ineffective Kitchen Receipt Printing System" titleIcon="/images/icon_title_about.svg" titleIconAlt="problem" />

**This story starts in the hot, crowded restaurant kitchen full of busy staff trying to handle too many printed food orders**. This old-fashioned approach has been so deeply ingrained in the daily life of the staff that they haven’t thought of confronting the system, despite experiencing its limitations first-hand.

<div className="image">![kitchen printed receipts](/images/printed_kitchen_receipts.png "")</div>

The high volume of printed receipts posed a challenge for the already busy kitchen staff, making it **difficult to keep track of them**. As a result, receipts often became mixed up, disrupting their proper order, and were prone to being lost or damaged, which made them difficult to read. 

They also proved ineffective as a tool for exchanging information. For instance, **kitchen personnel had no means of informing waitstaff about the progress of meal preparation**. This system also failed to provide relevant data regarding meal preparation to delivery providers, which resulted in **unrealistic delivery estimates**.

<div className="image">![printed kitchen receipt - example](/images/kitchen_receipt_order.png "An example of a printed receipt for a kitchen staff")</div>

Our product team uncovered these limitations, deciding to change printed receipts into a screen placed in the center of every restaurant kitchen. It was high time to put receipts into the past. Instead, a bespoke Kitchen Display System (KDS) has emerged.

<TitleWithIcon sectionTitle="the solution: digitalized kitchen receipts" titleIcon="/images/gearwheel.svg" titleIconAlt="the solution:" />

**The Kitchen Display System seamlessly presents all orders on an enormous kitchen screen**. Additionally, **kitchen staff can update order progress** effortlessly keeping waitstaff in the loop. 

**KDS eliminates receipts loss, reduces paper use, and optimizes the collaborative efforts between the kitchen and waitstaff**. Finally, both teams can dedicate their undivided attention to their core responsibilities: food preparation and customer service. 

The new system also **improves tracking of order preparation time**, enhancing delivery estimates. This not only **optimizes driver pickups** but also **improves customer satisfaction**.

<div className="image">![kitchen display system mockup](/images/kds_mockup.png "")</div>

Boosting productivity? That's another perk of our revamped system. We included color-coded indicators to identify orders that take too long to process. **The color-coding system is fully customizable, empowering restaurant staff to determine specific time thresholds associated with each color**. For instance, the red color might indicate that a meal has not been prepared within 20 minutes after ordering.

<TitleWithIcon sectionTitle="challenge: instant communication across multiple applications" titleIcon="/images/gearwheel.svg" titleIconAlt="challenge" />

The last thing that the kitchen staff should worry about is the quality of the internet connection. Therefore, **we implemented an offline mode, enabling crucial actions to be taken even offline**.

To **make the transition to KDS as smooth as possible** we had to ensure instant communication across multiple environments, involving the POS application, backend, KDS, and waitstaff application. By implementing a constant synchronization the system displayed new orders on the kitchen screen in a matter of seconds.

The Right UI was also a crucial factor in convincing restaurant staff to transition from their old system. **Our team collaborated closely with Practi's product designers to craft a simple, user-friendly UI that would appeal to even the most resistant end users**.

<TitleWithIcon sectionTitle="the results: successful launch across Israel and the UK" titleIcon="/images/icon_result_svg.svg" titleIconAlt="the results of the collaboration" />

After the successful launch of the Kitchen Display System, employees of numerous restaurants across Israel and the United Kingdom finally said goodbye to unloved receipts. **KDS became a remedy to all pain points of the outdated kitchen thermal receipt system**. That’s another weight lifted off the shoulders of restaurant workers during our 10-year collaboration with Practi. Let’s continue this journey. Destination: change!
