title: Crafting Stress-Free and Secure POS Bill Splitting for Restaurants
image: /images/case_study_bill_split_mechanism_pos.png
description: Bill splitting is a convenient way to share the cost for diners.
  Yet for waitstaff, it can be a source of stress, particularly when the
  technology doesn’t support them or even brings more hassle than benefits. Our
  team recognized this challenge and developed a stress-free splitting bill
  mechanism for restaurants. It involved navigating a maze of local tax
  regulations, ensuring every calculation was precise, analyzing secure data,
  and implementing a user-friendly interface for waitstaff.

After enjoying a delicious three-course meal, clients are ready to settle the bill and free up the table. But then, the waitstaff hears those dreaded words: “Can we split the bill?” **While customers love the convenience of splitting bills, it might be a different story for the waitstaff**. Their frustration typically stems from a POS system that doesn’t truly support bill splitting, making the process stressful and prone to errors.

<TitleWithIcon sectionTitle="the solution: bill splitting mechanism navigating waitstaff through the process" titleIcon="/images/flag.png" titleIconAlt="the solution" />

For a decade of collaboration with POS provider Practi (later acquired by Just Eat Takeaway.com), **we developed numerous features and applications, including the bill splitting that supports restaurants across Israel and the United Kingdom**.

Our bill-splitting solution allows the POS system to handle all possible scenarios, **enabling the division of any component of the bill – from individual courses to delivery fees and tips**. Customers can also split the payment by paying with a credit card, cash, or coupons.

*The system divides the total costs into the specific payments.*

The system is designed to **fully support waitstaff by providing all necessary calculations through a user-friendly interface**, eliminating the need for manual calculations. Restaurant staff simply provides details about the number of splits, discounts, and chosen payment methods, and the system guides them through the entire process. **It not only calculates the correct amounts but also ensures that the appropriate taxes are applied after the split**.
