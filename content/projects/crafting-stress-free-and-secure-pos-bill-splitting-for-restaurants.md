title: Crafting Stress-Free and Secure POS Bill Splitting for Restaurants
image: /images/case_study_bill_split_mechanism_pos.png
description: Bill splitting is a convenient way to share the cost for diners.
  Yet for waitstaff, it can be a source of stress, particularly when the
  technology doesnâ€™t support them or even brings more hassle than benefits. Our
  team recognized this challenge and developed a stress-free splitting bill
  mechanism for restaurants. It involved navigating a maze of local tax
  regulations, ensuring every calculation was precise, analyzing secure data,
  and implementing a user-friendly interface for waitstaff.
