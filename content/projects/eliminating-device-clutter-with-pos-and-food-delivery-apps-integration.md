description: From Uber Eats, Wolt to Just Eat and beyond, managing online orders
  from multiple food delivery platforms is challenging for busy waitstaff. To
  address this, while scaling the POS system for our client Practi (acquired by
  Just Eat Takeaway.com), we developed a solution that synchronizes all orders
  from various food delivery apps into a single device. Read the full story of
  how this integration alters restaurant operations.

<TitleWithIcon sectionTitle="the problem: handling online orders from various third-party delivery providers" titleIcon="/images/icon_title_about.svg" titleIconAlt="problem" />

Let’s step behind the restaurant counter and observe the waitstaff in action. In addition to serving in-house guests, they must **manage online orders from third-party food delivery platforms** like Wolt and Uber Eats. **Each platform provides its own device for managing orders**, adding to the growing number of devices that already overwhelm the busy staff (from a point-of-sale desktop to payment terminals, thermal printers, and more).

But **what if all third-party, in-house, and phone orders were automatically integrated into a single device**? That was the goal of the food delivery providers integration we developed for the Practi POS provider (later known as **Just Eat POS**) for restaurants in Israel and the UK.

<TitleWithIcon sectionTitle="the solution: all restaurant orders synchronized on one device" titleIcon="/images/flag.png" titleIconAlt="the solution:" />

A key aspect of this integration is menu synchronization. Any changes to the menu – such as prices, unavailable items, or ingredients – are automatically updated across all food delivery platforms, eliminating the need for waitstaff to manually update each one. 

However, if a restaurant wants to for example set different prices for various platforms, they can easily make those adjustments using the simple POS interface:

<div className="image">![POS delivery integration UI](/images/pos_delivery_integration_ui.png "POS UI")</div>

The true gem of this integration is **the real-time synchronization of every order on the Just Eat POS system**. Whether it's an online, on-site, or phone order, all information is automatically displayed on the primary POS device. This means the waitstaff can finally retire the multiple devices provided by third-party platforms. Now, **everything is accessible through the Just Eat POS device – the only one the restaurant needs**.

This automation also eliminates the errors occurring when busy staff manually transfer online orders to the main POS device so they can be sent to the kitchen. Now, **orders are processed automatically, speeding up meal preparation and delivery**. What’s more, order statuses are available on the same device, **keeping the waitstaff informed** throughout the process – from order acceptance to delivery.
