description: AirHelp mobile application lets you check if your flight is
  eligible for compensation and guides you through the whole process of
  complaints. AirHelp has assisted more than 16 million passengers all over the
  world. We cooperated with the company in 2015. We rewrote the previous iOS
  application that was just leading to the web page right after completing a
  couple of steps to a native technology.

## About

In 2015 [AirHelp](https://www.airhelp.com/en-gb/) was a fast-growing startup with a mission to educate passengers about their rights. AirHelp came to us with a basic version of their iOS app and expected us to rewrite it. We developed an MVP version of the app taking care of the backend. We helped AirHelp to launch a new version of the app in the AppStore. In the meantime, the client had time to build an in-house development team that could pursue the project in the future.

## Goal

The main goal was to create a mobile-friendly tool for users that want to file a complaint about a delayed or canceled flight. The app had to be really simple and minimalistic so that users are able to quickly go with the flow even if they have to provide much detailed information about the flight.

## Result

We developed an MVP version of an iOS app. After that AirHelp in-house development team could continue the project. Nowadays, AirHelps successfully completed the transformation from a startup to the top global air passengers’ rights advocate. We are happy that we could assist them at the beginning of their incredible journey.
