image: /images/case_study_cover_telemdicine_app.png
description: In a world where older and chronically ill people often find
  themselves isolated without easy access to healthcare, MedKitDoc emerges as a
  viable solution that can transform lives across Germany. This telehealth
  solution makes it easy for people to have doctor appointments without any
  compromises. It acts as a crucial link to vital healthcare services,
  especially for those who may face challenges accessing traditional care.

<TitleWithIcon sectionTitle="problem: increase in the population of elderly living alone" titleIcon="/images/three_flags.svg" titleIconAlt="problem" />

The story of MedKitDoc started before it was even founded. Its two **co-founders were unable to assist their chronically ill grandmother living hundreds of miles away**. Benjamin Gutermann, one of the co-founders and a doctor, found his skills ineffective over the distance. If only he could have listened to his grandmother's heart and checked her lung sounds. **Ultimately, their grandmother had to be hospitalized, which they believed might have been avoided**.

In Germany, the demographic trend indicates a significant increase in the population of elderly individuals, particularly those living alone. As of 2020, nearly 6 million people aged 65 or over were living alone, representing one in three people (34%) of that age group.

Remote patient monitoring and telehealth are essential for ensuring well-being and providing the necessary assistance before it's too late.
