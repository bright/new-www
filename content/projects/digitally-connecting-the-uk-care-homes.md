title: Digitally Connecting the UK Care Homes
image: /images/case_study_emar_ehealth.png
description: Nurses are forced to juggle the care of multiple patients, each
  with unique health profiles, medication plans, and allergy considerations. If
  only there was a digital solution that would streamline their work and help
  them avoid life-threatening mistakes. This is a story of a robust Electronic
  Medication Administration Record that not only organizes this complexity but
  also reduces the risk of errors.

## ![problem](/images/three_flags.svg) problem: transforming system inefficiencies to ensure patient safety

**In the United Kingdom, approximately [17,100 care homes are dedicated to accommodating over 400,000 individuals](https://www.braemarfinance.co.uk/s/insights/blog/facts-figures-uk-care-home-sector-MCXEQ2ZU7QKVFOBOP272VSXJDDWQ#:~:text=The%20care%20home%20sector%20in,after%20more%20than%20400%2C000%20people.)**. The UK's care home sector plays a pivotal role in supporting those in need of professional care.

In the extensive array of duties borne by care home providers, the task of **medicine distribution is a crucial and demanding responsibility**. The lack of digitalization in this area has cast a long shadow, leading to a confronting reality where **communication between pharmacies and care homes is fragmented and historical data on patient medication distribution alarmingly inaccessible**.

## ![solution](/images/goal_title_section.png) solution: a system that helps control medicine distribution

Our client is a UK-based health tech company aiming to streamline medicine distribution for care home professionals. 

![home care HealthTech](blob:https://brightinventions.pl/c34ed702-a0dd-44a5-b251-ac6091eb69e5 "home care HealthTech")

Upon the debut of their initial eMAR solution, **Camascope reached out to our team to explore a collaborative effort aimed at refining and advancing the product to a more sophisticated stage**. As a result, a comprehensive eMAR solution emerged. A mobile application, accessible on both Apple and Android devices, now **provides seamless access to patients' medical history and prescribed medications**.

This application facilitates **real-time updates on medication intake** accessible for healthcare providers, patients, and their families. The **offline mode empowers caregivers to make essential updates without concern for internet connectivity**.

Moreover, the **Camascope system mandates supervisor approval for significant treatment alterations. It also reduces errors by promptly notifying care home staff about potential missed medications**, alleviating the considerable responsibility of their workload.

## ![challenge](/images/gearwheel.svg) challenge: making a data-heavy and multifunctional system an intuitive one

**Our challenge was to help the client create a system that truly enhances daily operations instead of adding to the workload of care providers**. In response, we designed an interface that prioritizes essential information, ensuring all critical patient data is accessible on a single screen. Based on detailed field studies and research, we identified that end-users desire quick access to patient information and don’t want to navigate through multiple screens to obtain it. **Therefore, we prioritized creating an interface that is intuitive, speedy, and seamless to meet their needs**.

Navigating through another challenge, our collaboration intensified as we honed in on enhancing a pivotal HealthTech feature – **offline mode**. Recognizing the significance of a reliable app in time-sensitive situations, we worked closely to design an interface that distinctly indicates when users are in offline mode, fostering seamless data synchronization at a later stage.

## ![result](/images/results_icon_title_small.png) result: successful scaling and meds distribution digitalization

We helped our client during the crucial post-MVP phase to build a solution that addresses all the needs and requirements of the nurses and doctors working with the system. **eMAR now supports a wide range of care homes across the UK**. As the population ages, the demand for care services that allow older individuals to remain in their homes becomes increasingly important. Therefore, solutions like eMAR will play a significant role in digitizing healthcare.

During our collaboration with Camascope, we also built the [Remote Patient Monitoring with wearables and a telemedicine application](/projects/remote-patient-monitoring/). Read more about it in another case study!
