description: Behind the story of Camascope, there is a pharmacist who
  experienced firsthand the challenges care home professionals faced in
  medication distribution. This pharmacist was Saurabh Shah, the founder of
  Camascope (prev. vCare). With our help, Camascope now digitally streamlines
  daily medication routines for 25,000+ patients across the UK.

## ![problem](/images/three_flags.svg) problem: patients put at risk due to inefficient medicine distribution

**In the United Kingdom, approximately [17,100 care homes are dedicated to accommodating over 400,000 individuals](https://www.braemarfinance.co.uk/s/insights/blog/facts-figures-uk-care-home-sector-MCXEQ2ZU7QKVFOBOP272VSXJDDWQ#:~:text=The%20care%20home%20sector%20in,after%20more%20than%20400%2C000%20people.)**. The UK's care home sector plays a pivotal role in supporting those in need of professional care.

In the extensive array of duties borne by care home providers, the task of **medicine distribution is a crucial and demanding responsibility**. The lack of digitalization in this area has cast a long shadow, leading to a confronting reality where **communication between pharmacies and care homes is fragmented and historical data on patient medication distribution alarmingly inaccessible**.

## ![solution](/images/goal_title_section.png) solution: a system that helps control medicine distribution

**Camascope, formerly VCare Systems, a UK-based health tech company**, was co-founded by **[Saurabh Shah](https://blog.camascope.com/resources/post/the-camascope-story), a pharmacist with 15+ years of experience** whose vision led to the creation of the Electronic **Medication Administration Record (eMAR)**, streamlining medicine distribution for care home professionals.

Upon the debut of their initial eMAR solution, **Camascope reached out to our team to explore a collaborative effort aimed at refining and advancing the product to a more sophisticated stage**. As a result, a comprehensive eMAR solution emerged. A mobile application, accessible on both Apple and Android devices, now **provides seamless access to patients' medical history and prescribed medications**.

This application facilitates **real-time updates on medication intake** accessible for healthcare providers, patients, and their families. The **offline mode empowers caregivers to make essential updates without concern for internet connectivity**.

Moreover, the **Camascope system mandates supervisor approval for significant treatment alterations. It also reduces errors by promptly notifying care home staff about potential missed medications**, alleviating the considerable responsibility of their workload.

## ![challenge](/images/gearwheel.svg) challenge: making a data-heavy and multifunctional system an intuitive one

Imagine being a nurse, juggling the care of multiple patients, each with unique health profiles, medication plans, and allergy considerations. Healthcare providers grapple with a flood of information. **The crucial challenge was to create a system that not only organizes this complexity but also reduces the risk of errors**.

**We crafted a design that prioritizes crucial information while keeping all important patient data accessible on a single screen**. Based on detailed field studies and research, we understood that end-users desire quick access to patient information and don’t want to navigate through multiple screens to obtain it. Thus, ensuring the **interface is easy, fast, and smooth was the answer they needed**.

Another challenge was **building a system that would genuinely streamline daily processes**, rather than becoming an additional burden on the shoulders of care providers. Our team built a variety of features specifically crafted to streamline the daily operations of caregivers. For instance, **by scanning the barcodes of medications, the system automatically notifies which medicine has been administered, eliminating the need for manual input**.

An important feature we also incorporated was a user-friendly **body map, which enables physicians to quickly select a body part on the map, linking it to the administered medication or medical procedure**. This intuitive tool aids in both accuracy and efficiency in patient care.

Overcoming another hurdle, **we focused on refining a critical HealthTech feature – offline mode**. In situations where every second counts, having a reliable app without an internet connection is imperative. Our challenge was to **design an interface that unmistakably signals when users are in offline mode, ensuring seamless data synchronization at a later stage**. The emphasis here was on a clear and intuitive design.

## ![result](/images/results_icon_title_small.png) result: successful scaling with over 1,000 health care organization customers

**As an NHS Trusted Supplier and Crown Commercial Service Supplier Camascope has digitalised medicine distribution for over 1,000 health & care organizations**. The system is integrated with **leading pharmacy chains such as Boots, LloydsPharmacy, and Well**.

We are proud to have helped Camascope level up its solution during a crucial scaling phase. Currently, **the system supports over 25,000 active patients across the UK**, establishing itself as a leading mMedTech platform for British care homes.

During our collaboration with Camascope, we also built an [IOT system with MedTech wearables and a telemedicine application](/projects/remote-patient-monitoring/). Read more about it in another case study!
