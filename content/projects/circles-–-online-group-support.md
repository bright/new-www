<TitleWithIcon sectionTitle="problem: lack of access to mental health specialists in the USA" titleIcon="/images/icon_title_about.svg" titleIconAlt="problem" />

**More than 1 in 5 U.S. adults, roughly 57.8 million people — a number close to the population of Italy — live with a mental illness**. However, not everyone has the means to access mental health experts and receive the necessary assistance. 

This grim reality of mental health in the U.S. calls for a solution that not only provides Americans with professional mental health expertise but also offers something uniquely valuable in distressing moments: guidance and perspective from individuals who are grappling with similar issues.

**[Circles](https://circlesup.com/), an Israeli startup, has launched a mental health tech application** designed for those dealing with grief, divorce, or simply seeking a safe space to express their emotions.

After launching the pilot version, **Circles approached our team for expertise in scaling their product** in a competitive market. Initially involved in **web development**, we now offer support in other areas such as **mobile development** and **cloud computing**.

With Circles iOS or Android app, **users can easily join audio meetings led by mental health experts**. The audio drop-in and drop-out functionality, crafted by our team, not only offers easy access to mental support but also creates a sense of community. 

We also developed **numerous custom features to enhance the audio room experience, including user reactions, caller queuing, a call moderator panel, and an in-built chat**. Beyond group therapy sessions, Circles provides **continuous interaction with therapists** and a **personalized mental health plan** developed by its experts.
