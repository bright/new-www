## Circles Development Process

Circles is a support-groups platform developed by an Israeli startup. The client came to us thanks to the referral from our long-term client. We have started our cooperation in June 2021. The product was already launched. Our team of experienced bright Fullstack Developers joined to support product development. We are responsible for the web version of the app by delivering full stack solutions.

Since we came on board, we helped to develop a group chat adding new features such as: deleting the messages, attaching pictures or tagging people. What is more, we implemented a user-friendly [Circles group discovery section](https://circlesup.com/group-discovery/) which is a part of the onboarding process. It helps users to find the right support group to join. Naturally, we are also responsible for app maintenance and cloud services.

On top of that, we deliver solutions that enable analyzing data. For example, our team worked on a customized data tracking and processing solution that provides Circles specialists with automated reports widely covering users activity, experience or traffic sources. All this information enables planning new features and making strategic business decisions for further growth.

Bright Inventions works closely with the client, joining meetings with various teams to understand perspectives of every side including marketing and sales departments. Working with the Circles team means not only working on tech but also exploring the business nature of the project.
