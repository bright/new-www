title: Accessible 911 Call for People with Speech Disabilities [Confidential Project]
image: /images/case_study_emergency_911_app.png
description: The American emergency dispatch system, established in the 1960s,
  originally relied on landlines. Decades later, emergency call centers still do
  not support text messaging, which poses a challenge for people with speech
  disabilities to ask for help in the most stressful moments of their lives. To
  address this issue, we have partnered with a US-based NGO to develop an
  application that enables people to receive help without making a phone call.
