title: Empowering MHealth Systems with NHS-Certified Bluetooth Devices
image: /images/case_study_rpm_devices.png
description: The future of healthcare lies in remote medical care. With the
  system we had the privilege to develop for it is already a reality. Physicians
  can remotely monitor patients' conditions, and if their vital signs become
  alarming, the algorithm will trigger an alert, recommending the initiation of
  emergency procedures.

When COVID-19 swept across the world, it revealed the stark reality of global healthcare. **The traditional system, with staff shortages and the glaring lack of funding for public care, has not been able to face the rising challenges**. Among them are the mounting cases of chronic diseases and mental health issues. Healthcare cries out for a remedy. **Only technology can be the final cure**.

<TitleWithIcon sectionTitle="solution: empowering healthcare transformation with remote patient monitoring and telemedicine " titleIcon="/images/icon_title_goal.svg" titleIconAlt="solution: empowering healthcare transformation with remote patient monitoring and telemedicine " />

**We joined forces with our client based in the United Kingdom to find the cure for the healthcare sickness in the United Kingdom**. Our collaboration has already yielded a robust [Medicine Administration Record (eMAR) system](/projects/vCare/), available on both Android and iOS platforms. After that, we took another step towards healthcare digitalization.

**Our team developed a pilot Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) system for Android**. Imagine an application accessible by a doctor at their office, showing them in real-time the vital signs of their patients who are currently at home. With RPM, you don't have to imagine that anymore. It is now a reality available in the United Kingdom.

<div className="image">![Pulse oximeter](../../static/images/pulse_oximeter.png "Pulse oximeter")</div>

The RPM system is centered around an Android application, complemented by a couple of Bluetooth health-monitoring devices expertly integrated by the Bright Inventions team. **Smart devices such as pulse oximeters, spirometers, thermometers, or stethoscopes empower medical professionals to efficiently manage more patients** without the need for individual, time-consuming examinations. 

Another crucial step towards the digitalization of healthcare is **telemedicine**. We supported our client in this area as well. **Our team crafted an Android application supporting online consultations for users**. Patients have a scheduled consultation in the app; all they need to do is join the meeting, enabling the camera and microphone.

<TitleWithIcon sectionTitle="challenge: integrating Bluetooth devices into a single system" titleIcon="/images/two_flags.svg" titleIconAlt="the challenge" />

Our team faced the formidable **challenge of integrating various healthcare devices with distinct Software Development Kits (SDKs) into a cohesive system**. With our Android team's expertise, we successfully harmonized these disparate SDKs into a unified system. 

Furthermore, another compelling challenge involved d**eveloping an algorithm capable of rapidly detecting whether a patient's vital signs signal an urgent requirement for assistance**. Our team devised a solution that facilitates data transmission to the doctor, **triggering an alarm in the event the patient’s medical condition escalates to a life-threatening state**.
