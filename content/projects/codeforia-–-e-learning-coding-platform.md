<TitleWithIcon sectionTitle="about Codeforia" titleIcon="/images/icon_title_about.svg" titleIconAlt="about" />

[Codeforia](https://www.codeforia.com/) is a platform launched by a [programming school](https://www.jacektomasiewicz.pl/) established in 2015. Based on their experience in conducting effective programming courses, they decided to launch a customized web platform to offer a variety of paid online programming courses.

At Codeforia.com you will find over 200 programming challenges. The platform also enables you to automatically check your code and run it through test cases.

Our client’s goal was to quickly build an e-learning platform that would enrich their educational offering and enable them to acquire clients within the education sector such as schools and universities. 

Codeforia helps students start their journey to become software developers. It allows course participants to deepen their theoretical knowledge. Each topic is enriched with lists of programming tasks that can be solved directly within the application. Solved tasks are automatically evaluated thanks to automated test cases. This solution enables students to solidify their knowledge at their own pace. Furthermore, the platform allows group supervisors to closely monitor the progress of their students.

We started the collaboration in the Autumn of 2022 taking care of the frontend development while backend was developed by the client’s internal team. We worked in the Scrum methodology, conducting weekly meetings with the client, as well as sprint demos, retrospectives and planning.

Although we were responsible for the frontend we didn’t just implement the clients' design mockups. We proactively offered our guidance and shared best UX practices to enhance the end result. **On our recommendation, the client implemented various gamification features** including tracking learning progress, information about skills you already mastered and the ones yet to be discovered. **All in a bid to ensure better user engagement and a higher online course completion rate**.

<TitleWithIcon sectionTitle="outcome" titleIcon="/images/icon_result_svg.svg" titleIconAlt="outcome" />

The beta version of the platform was launched in January 2023. We remained in the development cycle during the first crucial months after launch. Finally, the project was fully handed over to the client’s internal team, in April 2023, following on from a successful launch.

We were thrilled to be involved in the development process and launch of the platform. We hope that many young people will discover their passion for programming with Codeforia!
