question: How much does product design cost?
answer: Thanks to the unique character of product design development the service
  has to be estimated individually. The price of product design depends on
  product advancement, business expectations, and required technologies. The
  easiest way to know the cost of design services is to [contact a product
  design company](/start-project) like Bright Inventions.
