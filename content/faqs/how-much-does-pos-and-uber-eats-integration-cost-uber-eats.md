question: How much does POS and Uber Eats integration cost?
answer: Since we develop custom POS integration solutions, the final price
  depends on various factors, such as the stage of your POS solution (MVP,
  scale-up, or [legacy POS](/projects/pos-legacy/)), the technology used, and
  your specific business requirements. Contact us, and we will prepare a
  proposal based on your expectations.
