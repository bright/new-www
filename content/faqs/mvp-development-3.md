question: How long does it take to develop MVP?
answer: The timeline of MVP app building process depends on the stage of your
  product development. Do you just have an idea for an app? Or maybe you already
  have a prototype? Usually, **creating the MVP prototype based on the idea
  takes 1-4 weeks**. Then **building an MVP app takes 4-20 weeks**.
