question: What is your experience in developing solutions for the restaurant industry?
answer: We have been scaling a [POS solution for the startup
  Practi](/projects/system-for-restaurants/) for over a decade. During this
  time, the solution became part of the Just Eat Takeaway.com family, enabling
  us to develop it on an even larger scale. Additionally, we have successfully
  launched a popular dining reservation app in Poland called
  [Finebite](/projects/everytap/). Our team also supports the startup
  [Relevo](/projects/eco-friendly-app/), which offers an app that enables
  renting reusable dishware for takeouts. If you would like to explore our
  portfolio further, [check out our clients' stories](/projects/).
