question: Do I need to have some experience in software development and Agile?
answer: Nope. 😉  Our job is to adjust the workshops to the experience and
  background of their participants. We are happy to work with teams that have
  just felt the urge to execute a more nimble approach to project management.
  Also, we’d love to cooperate with teams that have implemented Agile
  methodologies and have a feeling that it is not efficient enough.
