  **Ethereum is an open-source blockchain based on smart contracts.** It is
  known for developing Ether – the second most popular cryptocurrency (right
  after Bitcoin). Besides building cryptocurrency Ethereum enables to build
  chains for different purposes. This blockchain is very popular in finances and
  banking. For example, banks around the world use blockchain Ethereum to store
  public documents in a chain where they cannot be modified. Thanks to that
  every person might have access to public documents stored by a bank.
