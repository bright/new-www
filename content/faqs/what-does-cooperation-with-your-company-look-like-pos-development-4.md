question: What does cooperation with your company look like?
answer: >-
  Our collaboration begins with **kickoff workshops** where you will meet the
  POS development team. Together, we will **establish communication channels and
  schedule regular meetings**. We typically communicate daily via Slack and hold
  calls using Google Meet or your preferred platform. During the workshops,
  we'll also **create a detailed plan and estimate for the upcoming sprints**,
  so you'll know from the start what to expect.


  During the sprints, **we implement ideas and set up mechanisms to collect measurable data** on app performance and user behavior.


  **In the delivery phase, we present the results of each sprint** and prepare the scope for the next one, all while **gathering feedback for continuous improvement**.


  Finally, we **ensure the successful growth of your product**, taking full responsibility for high-quality deliverables.
