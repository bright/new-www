question: What is a typical product course agenda?
answer: >-
  Below you will find a template of the product workshop agenda. The final
  agenda is always adjusted to clients needs.


  Here is an **example of a product discovery workshop agenda**. In this case the client already knows what their business goals are and why they want to develop this product/service. Now we want to learn more about their users and how they will use the product.


  **Session 1 – Discover your users**


  **Personas** – a great tool for building empathy towards your users and understanding users’ needs (real user interview highly recommended).


  **Value proposition canvas** – discover features and create solutions that will be tailored to the client’s needs.


  **Session 2 – Create user journey**


  **User story mapping** – a visual collection of knowledge about existing processes in the form of a map.


  **Features documentation** – a process of documenting features based on the user journey.


  **Session 3 – Design fun** 


  **Round Robin** – a quick way to sketch and exchange ideas, when participants sketch, give their opinion and correct the sketches.


  **Design studio** – A tool based on group sketching – the simplest form of user interface prototyping.


  The number of days dedicated to the product workshop also depends on the time the client has. We can divide our process into several smaller sessions, or we can have a full day or a couple of days dedicated to the workshop.
