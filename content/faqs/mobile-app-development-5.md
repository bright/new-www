question: "[/our-areas/mvp-development](/our-areas/mvp-development)What is the
  mobile app development timeline?"
answer: The final software development timeline depends on the project and its
  requirements. In case a client expects only a prototype version of their idea,
  we usually **create a prototype during a 1 to 4 weeks period**. If a client
  wants to build an MVP, **we might develop MVPs in 4 to 20 weeks**. The final
  step – **developing and maintenance of the launched product** is the job that
  once the app succeeds **is never over**.
