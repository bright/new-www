question: What is the cost of website development?
answer: There are countless ways on how to approach the website development
  process. Therefore it is hard to talk about website costs without establishing
  the ground rules of cooperation. Depending on the chosen technology, type of
  the website and its goals a web agency can establish the cost. So the first
  step is always to contact a web development company to talk about the project
  and estimate the price.
