question: Why blockchain is secure?
answer: First of all, **blockchain is transparent** because data are
  decentralised and everyone has a view of each other actions. What is more, you
  cannot change the block hash without modifying previous blocks that is why
  **it is extremely difficult** **to modify the existing chain**. As an example,
  let’s explain the **Ethereum consensus of Proof of work** which secures the
  data. **Only a group of miners that control more than 50% of the network can
  influence the hash which is called the 51% rule.** This situation is
  practically impossible.
