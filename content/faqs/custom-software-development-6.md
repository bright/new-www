question: What is custom software development for healthcare?
answer: Building a custom healthcare app is all about understanding the needs of
  end-users. In terms of the healthcare sector, these users are often patients
  with chronic diseases. You have to deeply research their needs and come up
  with the solution that they truly need. No brainstorming will be enough if you
  simply don’t ask your users-to-be what software they need to manage their
  disease. We wrote more about [custom software development in
  healthcare](/blog/how-to-develop-a-healthcare-app-startup-owner-perspective/)
  on our blog.
