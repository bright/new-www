question: Can I work 100% remotely?
answer: >-
  Yes, you can. Our office is located in Gda≈Ñsk. However, **our employees are
  free to work from home**.


  If you choose to work remotely, **it would be great to meet once a quarter during the team retreats that we organize every 3 months**. üôÇ Plus we would appreciate it if you could come to the office to meet with the client in case they visit us.


  We hire people all over Poland. Feel free to apply, even if you do not come from Gda≈Ñsk. We have team members from other places, especially Toru≈Ñ, Pozna≈Ñ and Warsaw.
