question: How do you handle communication and updates throughout the project?
answer: >-
  Our collaboration primarily extends to clients from various countries and
  continents. We are committed to maintaining daily communication through
  platforms such as Slack and Google Meet. Additionally, we utilize tools like
  Jira and Miro to ensure that all project members are fully informed and
  engaged. 


  We also facilitate both off-site meetings with clients whenever the opportunity arises. Being located in Gdańsk gives us easy access to most European cities. By plane and train, we can usually reach our clients in just a couple of hours. That’s convenient for any face-to-face meetups.
