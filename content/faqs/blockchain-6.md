question: What is a smart contract?
answer: A smart contract is a code that is initiated in the blockchain. It
  represents some “business logic” that is part of the chain. **Practically
  speaking this piece of code called smart contract tells users conditions that
  they need to meet to execute the transaction and change the state.** In
  Ethereum a popular interface for smart contracts is **ERC20**. It is used to
  build its own cryptocurrencies. A well-known example of ERC20 implementation
  is **Dodge Coin**.
