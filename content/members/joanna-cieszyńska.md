She's passionate about user-centered design and likes to pay attention to the accessibility aspects of it. Just wants to make sure the products she's responsible for are inclusive and users get equal access to information, functionality, and experience of digital products. 

Aside from being a Product Designer, she is also an illustrator. In her free time, she likes to doodle something for fun. Also, keen on self-care and after a day of work makes sure to do some stretching and practice yoga.
