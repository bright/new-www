Bartek started his professional path by studying at the Gdańsk University of Technology. At first, he was a backend Java developer. Now he works mainly in frontend – React mostly. He is a real adventure seeker. Just before he’d walked into the Bright Inventions office for the first time, he spent few weeks in Nepal, hiking around Everest Base Camp. Apart from that, he likes street workouts, sailing, and swimming. Always smiling and enthusiastic.
