A backend developer with over 6 years of experience. Right now his focus is on DevOps and Monitoring. A big fan of Observability and tools like OpenTelemetry. However, deep down he will always be a backend developer first and foremost.

He believes nothing is impossible. Always looking for something new to learn and someone new to meet. Big fan of all kinds of comedy.
