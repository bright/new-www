An Agile romantic with a scientific mind and a zeal for learning. She divides her time between university teaching and enhancing project management processes. Believes in people-centered processes and the power of retrospective. Loves music and good food. Privately, a mum of two wild boys.

A mentor in the [Tech Leaders](https://techleaders.eu) – a program for women who want to develop their program management skills.
