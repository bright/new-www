Android Developer who loves self-development and hates boredom. He has decided to become a developer quite early – in Junior High School. Then he established his career path and started following it consistently. After high school he started studying Computer Studies at University of Gdańsk and right after the graduation he started his first job as a developer.

Sport and competition has been an important part of Krzysiek's life since his childhood. At the beginning it was football and playing in a football club, now it is a gym, occasional cycling and competitive games. He enjoys watching TV series and anime.
