She has always loved mathematics, logic tasks and cause and effect relationships, but for a long time she never touched computers. Finally, she tried programming and discovered that it was a whole new and fascinating world. With determination and motivation, she taught herself how to become a backend developer. Her willingness to learn, strong analytical thinking and science degree helped her a lot. It has been almost 3 years since she has worked as a developer. Privately, she also loves challenges, so she spends a lot of her free time in the climbing gym, where she prepares for adventures in the mountains. She has also recently started paragliding to get a wider view of the beautiful world.
