Backend Developer with 5 years of commercial experience. After completing his double MSc diploma studies in Signal Processing at the Gdańsk University of Technology in Poland and Blekinge Institute of Technology in Sweden he started working as an R&D engineer. There he quickly discovered that what really gives him joy is programming. He then transitioned to full time software development, first in Python and then in Java. 

Most recently he discovered Kotlin which he considers a happy medium between the two. He also worked a lot with Kubernetes and CI/CD tools which gave him quite a range of DevOps skills too. After work, he likes to go fishing or inline skating. His big love is making wine from homegrown fruits.
