We are a software development and consultancy studio based in Gdańsk, Poland. Since 2012 we have built software for more than 40 businesses worldwide, and have made a name for ourselves in a whole array of services: idea consulting, product design, software development, IoT, Blockchain, and more.

We founded Bright Inventions to create the place where we can do challenging things without superfluous micromanaging and red tape, where we feel responsible for the things we do, and where we can learn something new every day. Now we are looking for Senior Automation Developer - Mobile and Web to join our team and take on the challenge of building our automation infrastructure from scratch. 
 
This is a full time position. To succeed in this role, you should have strong and solid professional knowledge and experience in software development and automation best practices. If you have that and have excellent communication skills (in English) and are passionate about automating web and mobile products, we would like to meet you.

The project we will need your support at first is Practi - all-in-one operating system for restaurants that lets you manage all of your orders, including from delivery apps, from one place. More than just an EPOS, Practi does everything from taking customer orders in our tablet-based app to making menu changes in your virtual Back Office in the cloud with just a few clicks. From high-street chains to independent restaurants, market vendors and more, Practi is helping business owners to run their restaurants more efficiently.
