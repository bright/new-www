              Blockchain is an area we’re especially proud of being experts in –
              not only because it’s a groundbreaking technology, but also
              because of its global, humanitarian impact. We’re honored to have
              been entrusted with a major Blockchain for social impact project –
              a global food assistance program that helps wire cash to some of
              the most impoverished communities in the world.
